## Beowulf-s

Beowulf-s was inspired by reading Maria Dahvana Headley's introduction in *Beowulf: a New Translation* (2020, [see excerpt](https://us.macmillan.com/excerpt?isbn=9780374720155){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'}).
There is something bewildering about how many translations this strange archaic bit of poetry inspired, forming a unique corpus of texts struggling to express some vision of the archetypal story.

Chauncey B. Tinker's 1903 *The Translations of Beowulf: A Critical Bibliography* is a monument to this endeavour, pulling together a list of impactful translations in various languages and providing introduction, extracts, and criticism.

Tinker's work is well structured with each entry containing a repeating set descriptive sections.
The `beowulf-s` project used the formatting cues in the digitized text with OpenRefine to parse Tinker's content into tabular data.
The results were refined and enhanced, including adding links to digitized editions of the works.

This data drives the website forming a browseable digital collection from the original book's text and can downloaded on the [Data page]({{ '/data.html' | relative_url }}).

Future work on the project will add texts and aggregate data formats from the cited works (timeline = *someday*).
