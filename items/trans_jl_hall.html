<p>Presented to the Philosophical Faculty of Johns Hopkins University in
candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by John Lesslie Hall,
late Professor in the college of William and Mary.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The work is addressed to two classes of readers. . . .
The Anglo-Saxon scholar he [the translator] hopes to please by adhering
faithfully to the original. The student of English literature he aims to
interest by giving him, in modern garb, the most ancient epic of our
race.’ —Preface, vii.
</blockquote>



<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is in imitative measures and in archaic style.</p>

<blockquote>
‘The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern
poetry. . . .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
reproduction of the original as modern English
affords. . . . The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse
are retained, and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is
consistent with a regular cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large
extent; but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it in
every line. End-rhyme has been used occasionally; internal rhyme,
sporadically. . . .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘What Gummere calls the “rime-giver” has been studiously kept; viz., the
first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
sporadically. . . .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘No two accented syllables have been brought together, except
occasionally after a cæsural pause. . . . Or,
scientifically speaking, Sievers’s C type has been avoided as not
consonant with the plan of translation.’ —Preface, viii, ix.
</blockquote>


<h5>Text.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed.
Occasionally a deviation has been made. . . . Once in a
while . . . (the translator) has added a conjecture of
his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students
of the poem.’ —Preface, vii.
</blockquote>

<p>The footnotes which contain the conjectural readings are interesting,
and in one or two cases valuable additions to the suggested emendations
(cf. p. 15; p. 103, note 3).</p></div>

<h5 class="smallcaps">Unferth taunts Beowulf.</h5>

<div class="verse lines">

<p class="sidenote">
Unferth, a thane of Hrothgar, is jealous of Beowulf, and undertakes to
twit him.</p>

<p>Unferth spoke up, Ecglaf his son,</p>
<p>Who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,</p>
<p>Opened the jousting (the journey of Beowulf,</p>
<p>Sea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth</p>
<span class="linenum">5</span>
<p>And greatest chagrin, too, for granted he never</p>
<p>That any man else on earth should attain to,</p>
<p>Gain under heaven, more glory than he):</p>

<p class="sidenote">
Did you take part in a swimming-match with Breca?</p>

<p>‘Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,</p>
<p>On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,</p>
<span class="linenum">10</span>
<p>Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,</p>
<p>From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies</p>

<p class="sidenote">
’Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the
ocean.</p>

<p>In care of the waters? And no one was able</p>
<p>Nor lief nor loth one, in the least to dissuade you</p>
<p>Your difficult voyage; then ye ventured a-swimming,</p>
<span class="linenum">15</span>
<p>Where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover,</p>
<p>The mere-ways measured, mixing and stirring them,</p>
<p>Glided the ocean; angry the waves were,</p>
<p>With the weltering of winter. In the water’s possession,</p>
<p>Ye toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,</p>
<span class="linenum">20</span>
<p>In strength excelled thee. Then early at morning</p>
<p>On the Heathoremes’ shore the holm-currents tossed him,</p>
<p>Sought he thenceward the home of his fathers,</p>
<p>Beloved of his liegemen, the land of the Brondings,</p>
<p>The peace-castle pleasant, where a people he wielded</p>
<span class="linenum">25</span>

<p class="sidenote">
Breca outdid you entirely. Much more will Grendel outdo you, if you vie
with him in prowess.</p>

<p>Had borough and jewels. The pledge that he made thee</p>
<p>The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.</p>
<p>Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,</p>
<p>Though ever triumphant in onset of battle,</p>
<p>A grim grappling, if Grendel thou darest</p>
<span class="linenum">30</span>
<p>For the space of a night near-by to wait for!</p>
</div></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><p>The translation is faithful, but not literal. The chief difference,
for example, between this and the translation by Garnett is that Hall
makes an attempt to preserve the poetic value of the Old English words.
He is never satisfied with the dictionary equivalent of an Old English
expression. Thus, in the extract given above, ‘from vainest vaunting’ is
given as a translation of <i>dol-gilpe</i>—a great
improvement over Garnett’s rendering, ‘for pride.’ Similarly, ‘mixing
and stirring’ is given as a translation of <i>mundum brugdon</i>. This
method often leads the translator some distance, perhaps too great a
distance, from the Old English. The following may serve as examples of
the heightened color that Hall gives to the Old English
forms:—</p>

<table class="lines" summary="details of translations">
<tbody><tr><td>
<p>548, ‘the north-wind whistled, fierce in our faces,’ for
<i>norþan-wind heaðo-grim ondhwearf</i>.</p>

<p>557, ‘my obedient blade,’ for <i>hilde-bille</i>.</p>

<p>568, ‘foam-dashing currents,’ for <i>brontne ford</i>.</p>

<p>587, ‘with cold-hearted cruelty thou killedst thy brothers,’ for
<i>ðū þīnum brōðrum tō banan wurde</i>.</p>

<p>606, ‘the sun in its ether robes,’ for <i>sunne swegl-wered</i>.</p>

<p>838, ‘in the mist of the morning,’ for <i>on morgen</i>.</p>

<p>1311, ‘As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,’ for
<i>ǣr-dæge</i>.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Perhaps these paraphrastic renderings are what Dr. Hall is referring
to when he says in his preface, regarding the nature of the translation,
‘Occasionally some loss has been sustained; but, on the other hand,
a gain has here and there been made<ins class="correction" title="close quote missing">.’ </ins></p>

<p>As for the archaism, that is well enough for those who like it. It is
never so strange as that of Earle, or the marvelous diction of William
Morris. But it is not, therefore,

dignified or clear. How much dignity and clarity a translator has a
right to introduce into his rendering is a matter of opinion. Mr. Hall
was quite conscious of what he was doing, and doubtless regarded his
diction as well suited to convey the original Beowulf spirit.</p>

<p>The chief criticism of the verse is that it is often not verse at
all. Many passages are indistinguishable from prose. This is a stricture
that cannot be passed on the Old English, nor on the best modern
imitations of it.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="indent">
The atheling of Geatmen uttered these words and</p>
<p>Heroic did hasten. —Page 51, line 19.</p>

<p class="stanza indent">
In war ’neath the water the work with great pains I</p>
<p>Performed. —Page 57, line 6.</p>

<p class="stanza indent">
Gave me willingly to see on the wall a</p>
<p>Heavy old hand-sword. —Page 57, line 11.</p>

<p class="stanza indent">
The man was so dear that he failed to suppress the</p>
<p>Emotions that moved him. —Page 64, line 59.</p>
</div>

<p>There might be an excuse for some of this freedom in blank verse, but
in measures imitative of the Old English it is utterly out of place.
There is always a pause at the end of a line in Old English; run-on
lines are uncommon. There is not an example in <i>Beowulf</i> of an
ending so light as <ins class="correction" title="open quote invisible">‘the’</ins> or ‘a’ in the verses quoted above.</p></div>
