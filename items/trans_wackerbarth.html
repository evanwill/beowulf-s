<p>In the introduction Wackerbarth gives a full account of the history
of the book:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘With respect to the Work now presented to the Public, shortly after the
putting forth of Mr. Kemble’s Edition of the Anglo-Saxon Text in 1833 I
formed the Design of translating it, and early in 1837 I commenced the
Work. Mr. Kemble’s second Volume had not then appeared, and I proceeded
but slowly, on account of the Difficulty of the Work, and the utter
Inadequacy of any then existing Dictionary. I still however wrought
my Way onward, under the Notion that even if I should not think my Book,
when finished, fit for Publication, yet that the MS. would form an
amusing Tale for my little Nephews and Nieces, and so I went through
about a Quarter of the Poem when Illness put an entire stop to my
Progress. Afterwards, though the Appearance of Mr. Kemble’s additional
Volume, containing the Prose

Version, Glossary, &amp;c. had rendered the remainder of my Task
comparatively easy, other Matters required my Attention, and the MS. lay
untouched until 1842, between which Time and the present it has been
from Time to Time added to and at length completed, and the whole
carefully revised, much being cancelled and retranslated.’
—Introduction, p. viii.
</blockquote>


<h5>Indebtedness to preceding Scholars.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘In my Version I have scrupulously adhered to the text of Mr. Kemble,
adopting in almost every Instance his Emendations. . . .
My thanks are due to Mr. Kemble . . . to the Rev. Dr.
Bosworth . . . who have . . . kindly
answered my Inquiries relative to various Matters connected with the
poem.’ —Pages viii, xiv.
</blockquote>


<h5>Style and Diction.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘I have throughout endeavoured to render the Sense and the Words of my
Author as closely as the English Language and the Restraints of Metre
would allow, and for this Purpose I have not shrunken either from
sacrificing Elegance to Faithfulness (for no Translator is at liberty to
misrepresent his Author and make an old Saxon Bard speak the Language of
a modern Petit Maître) or from uniting English Words to express
important Anglo-Saxon compounds. . . . Some may ask why I
have not preserved the Anglo-Saxon alliterative Metre. My Reason is that
I do not think the Taste of the English People would at present bear it.
I wish to get my book read, that my Countrymen may become generally
acquainted with the Epic of our Ancestors wherewith they have been
generally unacquainted, and for this purpose it was necessary to adopt a
Metre suited to the Language; whereas the alliterative Metre, heavy even
in German, a Language much more fitted for it than ours, would in
English be so heavy that few would be found to labour through a Poem of
even half the Length of the Beówulf’s lay when presented in so
unattractive a Garb.’ —Pages ix, x.

            <div class="mb-3"><p>Wackerbarth’s translation is not to be considered as a rival of
Kemble’s<a class="tag" name="tag_wackerbarth1" id="tag_wackerbarth1" href="#note_wackerbarth1">1</a>—the author
did not wish it to be

so considered. Kemble addressed the world of scholars; Wackerbarth the
world of readers. Wackerbarth rather resembles Conybeare<a class="tag" name="tag_wackerbarth2" id="tag_wackerbarth2" href="#note_wackerbarth2">2</a> in trying to reproduce the <i>spirit</i> of
the poem, and make his book appeal to a popular audience. Wackerbarth
had the advantage of basing his translation on the accurate and
scholarly version of Kemble; yet Conybeare and Wackerbarth were equally
unsuccessful in catching the spirit of the original. The reason for
their failure is primarily in the media which they chose. It would seem
that if there were a measure less suited to the Beowulf style than the
Miltonic blank verse used by Conybeare, it would be the ballad measures
used by Wackerbarth. The movement of the ballad is easy, rapid, and
garrulous. Now, if there are three qualities of which the <i>Beowulf</i>
is not possessed, they are ease, rapidity, and garrulity. Not only does
the poet avoid superfluous words—the ballad never does—but
he frequently does not use words enough. His meaning is thus often vague
and nebulous, or harsh and knotted. Nor can the poem properly be called
rapid. It is often hurried, and more often insufficient in detail, but
it never has sustained rapidity. The kenning alone is hostile to
rapidity. The poet lingers lovingly over his thought as if loath to
leave it; he repeats, amplifies. The description of Grendel’s approach
to Heorot is given three times within twenty lines.</p>

<p>Now these features which have just been described Wackerbarth’s
ballad lines are eminently unfitted to transmit. But there is still
another reason for shunning them. They are almost continuously
suggestive of Scott. Of all men else the translator of <i>Beowulf</i>
should avoid Scott. Scott’s medievalism is hundreds of years and miles
away from the medievalism of <i>Beowulf</i>. His is the self-conscious,
dramatic, gorgeous age of

chivalry, of knight and lady, of pomp and pride. <i>Beowulf</i> is
simple to bareness.</p>

<p>It is in such strong picturesque passages as the swimming-match that
Wackerbarth’s style is worst. There is a plethora of adjectives,
scarcely one of which is found in the original; but they are of no
avail—they are too commonplace to render the strength and raciness
of the original words. There is too much ballad padding—‘then he
cry’d,’ ‘at last,’ ‘well and faithfully,’ ‘onslaught dire, and deadly
fight.’ Hunferth prattles. The heroic atmosphere is gone.</p>

<p>In passages calling for calmness, solemnity, or elevation of
thought—and there are many such—the easy flow of a verse
monotonous and trivial effectually destroys the beauty of the lines.</p>

<p>But in spite of its very evident limitations, Wackerbarth’s
translation was a move in the right direction. His aim, in his own
words, was to ‘get his book read,’ and he was wise in choosing a medium
that would be popular, even if it were not satisfactory to the scholar.
It was better to have <i>Beowulf</i> according to Wackerbarth than no
<i>Beowulf</i> at all.</p></div>
