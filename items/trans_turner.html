              <h5>Points of Difference between the Various Editions.</h5>

              <p>A part of this may be stated in the words of the author:—</p>

              <blockquote>
                ‘The poem had remained untouched and unnoticed both here and
                abroad until I observed its curious contents, and in 1805
                announced it to the public. I could then give it only a hasty
                perusal, and from the MS. having a leaf interposed near its
                commencement, which belonged to a subsequent part, and from the
                peculiar obscurity which sometimes attends the Saxon poetry, I
                did not at that time sufficiently comprehend it, and had not
                leisure to apply a closer attention. But in the year 1818 I took
                it up again, as I was preparing my third edition, and then made
                that more correct analysis which was inserted in that and the
                subsequent editions, and which is also exhibited in the
                present.’ —Sixth edition, p. 293, footnote.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                The statement that the poem had remained untouched and unnoticed
                is not strictly true. The public had not yet received any
                detailed information regarding it; but Wanley<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_turner1"
                  id="tag_turner1"
                  href="#note_turner1"
                  >1</a
                >
                had mentioned the <i>Beowulf</i> in his catalog, and Thorkelin
                had already made two transcripts of the poem, and was at work
                upon an edition. Turner, however, deserves full credit for first
                calling the attention of the English people to the importance of
                the poem.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the third edition, of which the author speaks, many
                improvements were introduced into the digest of the story and
                some improvements into the text of the translations. Many of
                these were gleaned from the <i>editio princeps</i> of
                Thorkelin<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_turner2"
                  id="tag_turner2"
                  href="#note_turner2"
                  >2</a
                >. The story is now told with a fair degree of accuracy,
                although many serious errors remain: e.g. the author did not
                distinguish the correct interpretation of the swimming-match, an
                extract of which is given below. The translations are about as
                faulty as ever, as may be seen by comparing the two extracts. In
                the first edition only the first part of the poem is treated; in
                the third, selections from the second part are added.
              </p>

              <p>
                No further changes were made in later editions of the History.
              </p>

              <p>
                Detailed information regarding differences between the first
                three editions may be found below.
              </p>

              <h5>Turner, and his Knowledge of Old English.</h5>

              <p>
                Sharon Turner (1768–1847) was from early youth devoted to the
                study of Anglo-Saxon history, literature, and antiquities. His
                knowledge was largely derived from the examination of original
                documents in the British Museum<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_turner3"
                  id="tag_turner3"
                  href="#note_turner3"
                  >3</a
                >. But the very wealth of the new material which he found for
                the study of the literature kept him from making a thorough
                study of it. It is to be remembered that at this time but little
                was known of the peculiar nature of the Old English poetry.
                Turner gives fair discussions of the works of Bede and Ælfric,
                but he knows practically nothing of the poetry. With the
                so-called <i>Paraphrase</i> of Cædmon he is, of course,
                familiar; but his knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i> and
                <i>Judith</i> is derived from the unique, and at that time
                (1805) unpublished, MS., Cotton Vitellius A. xv. Of the contents
                of the Exeter Book he knew nothing. The Vercelli Book had not
                yet been discovered. The materials at hand for his study were a
                faulty edition of Cædmon and an insufficient dictionary. The
                author, whose interest was of course primarily in history, was
                not familiar with the linguistic work of the day. It is,
                therefore, not surprising that his work was not of the best
                quality.

                ‘The most interesting remains of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which
                time has suffered to reach us, are contained in the Anglo-Saxon
                poem in the Cotton Library, Vitellius A. 15. Wanley mentions it
                as a poem in which “seem to be described the wars which one
                Beowulf, a Dane of the royal race of the Scyldingi, waged
                against the reguli of Sweden<a

                  >4</a
                >.” But this account of the contents of the MS. is incorrect. It
                is a composition more curious and important. It is a narration
                of the attempt of Beowulf to wreck the fæthe or deadly feud on
                Hrothgar, for a homicide which he had committed. It may be
                called an Anglo-Saxon epic poem. It abounds with speeches which
                Beowulf and Hrothgar and their partisans make to each other,
                with much occasional description and sentiment.’ —Book vi, chap.
                iv, pp. 398 ff.

              <h5>The Story of the Poem as Interpreted by Turner.</h5>

              <p>
                ‘It begins with a proemium, which introduces its hero Beowulf to
                our notice. . . . The poet then states the embarkation of
                Beowulf and his partisans. . . .’ Turner interprets the prolog
                as the description of the embarkation of Beowulf on a piratical
                expedition. The accession of Hrothgar to the throne of the Danes
                is then described, and the account of his ‘homicide’ is given.
                This remarkable mistake was caused by the transposition of a
                sheet from a later part of the poem—the fight with Grendel—to
                the first section of the poem. The sailing of Beowulf and the
                arrival in the Danish land are then given. Turner continues:
                ‘The sixth section exhibits Hrothgar’s conversation with his
                nobles, and Beowulf’s introduction and address to him. The
                seventh section opens with Hrothgar’s answer to him, who
                endeavours to explain the circumstance of the provocation. In
                the eighth section a new speaker appears, who is introduced, as
                almost all the personages in the poem are mentioned, with some
                account of his parentage and character.’ Then follows the
                extract given below.

              </div>

              <p>
                After this extract, Turner continues:— ‘It would occupy too much
                room in the present volume to give a further account of this
                interesting poem, which well deserves to be submitted to the
                public, with a translation and with ample notes. There are
                forty-two sections of it in the Cotton MS., and it ends there
                imperfectly. It is perhaps the oldest poem of an epic form in
                the vernacular language of Europe which now exists.’
              </p>

              <p>In the second edition the following lines were added:—</p>

                ‘Hunferth, “the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the lord

                reputation, and as refusing to any man more celebrity than
                himself. He is represented as taunting Beowulf on his exploits

                Detailed criticism of the extracts is unnecessary. They are, of
                course, utterly useless to-day. Sufficient general criticism of
                the work is found in the preceding sections devoted to a
                discussion of the author and his knowledge of Old English and of
                the <i>Beowulf</i>.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the third edition the author presents some criticisms of
                Thorkelin’s text; but his own work is quite as faulty as the
                Icelander’s, and his ‘corrections’ are often misleading.
              </p>

              <p>
                Turner is to be censured for allowing an account of
                <i>Beowulf</i> so full of inaccuracy to be reprinted year after
                year with no attempt at its improvement or even a warning to the
                public that it had been superseded by later and more scholarly
                studies.
