<p>A part of this may be stated in the words of the author:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘The poem had remained untouched and unnoticed both here and abroad
until I observed its curious contents, and in 1805 announced it to the
public. I could then give it only a hasty perusal, and from the MS.
having a leaf interposed near its commencement, which belonged to a
subsequent part, and from the peculiar obscurity which sometimes attends
the Saxon poetry, I did not at that time sufficiently comprehend
it, and had not leisure to apply a closer attention. But in the year
1818 I took it up again, as I was preparing my third edition, and then
made that more correct analysis which was inserted in that and the
subsequent editions, and which is also exhibited in the present.’
—Sixth edition, p. 293, footnote.
</blockquote>


<p>The statement that the poem had remained untouched and unnoticed is
not strictly true. The public had not yet received any detailed
information regarding it; but Wanley<a class="tag" name="tag_turner1" id="tag_turner1" href="#note_turner1">1</a> had
mentioned the <i>Beowulf</i> in his catalog, and Thorkelin had already
made two transcripts of the poem, and was at work upon an edition.
Turner, however, deserves full credit for first calling the attention of
the English people to the importance of the poem.</p>

<p>In the third edition, of which the author speaks, many improvements
were introduced into the digest of the story and some improvements into
the text of the translations. Many of these were gleaned from the
<i>editio princeps</i> of Thorkelin<a class="tag" name="tag_turner2" id="tag_turner2" href="#note_turner2">2</a>. The story is now told
with a fair degree of accuracy, although many serious errors remain:
e.g. the author did not distinguish the correct interpretation of the
swimming-match, an extract of which is given below. The translations are
about as faulty as ever, as may be seen by comparing the two extracts.
In the first edition only the first part of the poem is treated; in the
third, selections from the second part are added.</p>

<p>No further changes were made in later editions of the History.</p>

<p>Detailed information regarding differences between the first three
editions may be found below.</p>


<h5>Turner, and his Knowledge of Old English.</h5>

<p>Sharon Turner (1768–1847) was from early youth devoted to the
study of Anglo-Saxon history, literature, and antiquities. His knowledge
was largely derived from the examination of original documents in the
British Museum<a class="tag" name="tag_turner3" id="tag_turner3" href="#note_turner3">3</a>. But the very wealth of the new material
which he found for the study of the literature kept him from making a
thorough study of it. It is to be remembered

that at this time but little was known of the peculiar nature of the Old
English poetry. Turner gives fair discussions of the works of Bede and
Ælfric, but he knows practically nothing of the poetry. With the
so-called <i>Paraphrase</i> of Cædmon he is, of course, familiar; but
his knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Judith</i> is derived from the
unique, and at that time (1805) unpublished, MS., Cotton Vitellius A.
xv. Of the contents of the Exeter Book he knew nothing. The Vercelli
Book had not yet been discovered. The materials at hand for his study
were a faulty edition of Cædmon and an insufficient dictionary. The
author, whose interest was of course primarily in history, was not
familiar with the linguistic work of the day. It is, therefore, not
surprising that his work was not of the best quality.</p>


<h5>Lines in the Poem Translated by Turner.</h5>

<p>First edition: 18–40; 47–83a; 199b-279; 320–324;

1215b-1226a; 1240b-1246a; and a few other detached lines.</p>


<h5><a name="trans_turner_account" id="trans_turner_account">
Turner’s Account of Beowulf in the First Edition of his
History.</a></h5>

<blockquote>
‘The most interesting remains of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which time has
suffered to reach us, are contained in the Anglo-Saxon poem in the
Cotton Library, Vitellius A. 15. Wanley mentions it as a poem in which
“seem to be described the wars which one Beowulf, a Dane of the
royal race of the Scyldingi, waged against the reguli of Sweden<a class="tag" name="tag_turner4" id="tag_turner4" href="#note_turner4">4</a>.” But this account of the contents of the MS. is
incorrect. It is a composition more curious and important. It is a
narration of the attempt

of Beowulf to wreck the fæthe or deadly feud on Hrothgar, for a homicide
which he had committed. It may be called an Anglo-Saxon epic poem. It
abounds with speeches which Beowulf and Hrothgar and their partisans
make to each other, with much occasional description and sentiment.’
—Book vi, chap. iv, pp. 398 ff.
</blockquote>

<h5>The Story of the Poem as Interpreted by Turner.</h5>

<p>‘It begins with a proemium, which introduces its hero Beowulf to our
notice. . . . The poet then states the embarkation of
Beowulf and his partisans. . . .’ Turner interprets the
prolog as the description of the embarkation of Beowulf on a piratical
expedition. The accession of Hrothgar to the throne of the Danes is then
described, and the account of his ‘homicide’ is given. This remarkable
mistake was caused by the transposition of a sheet from a later part of
the poem—the fight with Grendel—to the first section of the
poem. The sailing of Beowulf and the arrival in the Danish land are then
given. Turner continues: ‘The sixth section exhibits Hrothgar’s
conversation with his nobles, and Beowulf’s introduction and address to
him. The seventh section opens with Hrothgar’s answer to him, who
endeavours to explain the circumstance of the provocation. In the eighth
section a new speaker appears, who is introduced, as almost all the
personages in the poem are mentioned, with some account of his parentage
and character.’ Then follows the extract given below.</p></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><div class="verse">
<p><span class="firstword">Hunferth</span> spoke</p>
<p>The son of Ecglafe;</p>
<p>Who had sat at the foot</p>
<p>Of the lord of the Scyldingi</p>
<p>Among the band of the battle mystery.</p>
<p>To go in the path of Beowulf</p>
<p>Was to him a great pride;</p>
<p>He was zealous</p>
<p>That to him it should be granted</p>
<p>That no other man</p>

<p class="indent">
Was esteemed greater in the world</p>
<p>Under the heavens than himself.</p>
<p class="indent">
‘Art thou Beowulf</p>
<p>He that with such profit</p>
<p>Dwells in the expansive sea,</p>
<p>Amid the contests of the ocean?</p>
<p>There yet<a class="tag" name="tag_turner5" id="tag_turner5" href="#note_turner5">5</a> for riches go!</p>
<p>You try for deceitful glory</p>
<p>In deep waters<a class="tag" name="tag_turner6" id="tag_turner6" href="#note_turner6">6</a>.—</p>
<p>Nor can any man,</p>
<p>Whether dear or odious,</p>
<p>Restrain you from the sorrowful path—</p>
<p>There yet<a class="tag" name="tag_turner7" id="tag_turner7" href="#note_turner7">7</a> with eye-streams</p>
<p>To the miserable you<a class="tag" name="tag_turner8" id="tag_turner8" href="#note_turner8">8</a> flourish:</p>
<p>You meet in the sea-street;</p>
<p>You oppress with your hands;</p>
<p><a class="tag" name="tag_turner9" id="tag_turner9" href="#note_turner9">9</a>You glide over the ocean’s waves;</p>
<p>The fury of winter rages,</p>
<p>Yet on the watery domain</p>
<p>Seven nights have ye toiled.’</p>
</div>

<p>After this extract, Turner continues:— ‘It would occupy too
much room in the present volume to give a further account of this
interesting poem, which well deserves to be submitted to the public,
with a translation and with ample notes. There are forty-two sections of
it in the Cotton MS., and it ends there imperfectly. It is perhaps the
oldest poem of an epic form in the vernacular language of Europe which
now exists.’</p>


<p>In the second edition the following lines were added:—</p>

<p>‘After Hunferthe, another character is introduced:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>Dear to his people,</p>
<p>of the land of the Brondingi;</p>
<p>the Lord of fair cities,</p>
<p>where he had people,</p>
<p>barks, and bracelets,</p>
<p>Ealwith, the son of Beandane,</p>
<p>the faithful companion</p>
<p>menaced.</p>
<p class="indent">
“Then I think</p>
<p>worse things will be to thee,</p>
<p>thou noble one!</p>
<p>Every where the rush</p>
<p>of grim battle will be made.</p>
<p>If thou darest the grendles,</p>
<p>the time of a long night</p>
<p>will be near to thee.”’</p>
</div>


<h5><a name="trans_turner_third" id="trans_turner_third">
Third Edition.</a></h5>

<p>‘Hunferth, “the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the lord of the
Scyldingi.” He is described as jealous of Beowulf’s reputation, and as
refusing to any man more celebrity than himself. He is represented as
taunting Beowulf on his exploits as a sea-king or vikingr.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="indent">
“Art thou Beowulf,</p>
<p>he that with such profit</p>
<p>labours on the wide sea,</p>
<p>amid the contests of the ocean?</p>
<p>There you for riches,</p>
<p>and for deceitful glory,</p>
<p>explore its bays</p>
<p>in the deep waters,</p>
<p>till you sleep with your elders.</p>
<p>Nor can any man restrain you,</p>
<p>whether dear or odious to you,</p>
<p>from this sorrowful path.</p>
<p>There you rush on the wave;</p>
<p>there on the water streams:</p>

<p>from the miserable you flourish.</p>
<p>You place yourselves in the sea-street;</p>
<p>you oppress with your hands;</p>
<p>you glide over the ocean</p>
<p>through the waves of its seas.</p>
<p>The fury of the winter rages,</p>
<p>yet on the watery domain</p>
<p>seven nights have ye toiled.”’</p>
</div></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><p>Detailed criticism of the extracts is unnecessary. They are, of
course, utterly useless to-day. Sufficient general criticism of the work
is found in the preceding sections devoted to a discussion of the author
and his knowledge of Old English and of the <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>In the third edition the author presents some criticisms of
Thorkelin’s text; but his own work is quite as faulty as the
Icelander’s, and his ‘corrections’ are often misleading.</p>

<p>Turner is to be censured for allowing an account of <i>Beowulf</i> so
full of inaccuracy to be reprinted year after year with no attempt at
its improvement or even a warning to the public that it had been
superseded by later and more scholarly studies.</p></div>
