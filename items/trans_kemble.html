            <div class="mb-3"><h5>The 1833 Volume.</h5>

<p>A sufficient account of this volume is given by Professor Earle, who
says of it:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘The text was an improvement on Thorkelin, but still very
faulty;—to say nothing of inaccuracies from want of proper
oversight as the sheets were passing through the press. The Glossary,
though short, was a valuable acquisition . . . Of this
edition only 100 copies were printed;—and it was a happy
limitation, as it left room for a new edition as early as 1835, in which
the text was edited with far greater care. All the rest remained as
before, and the Preface was reprinted word for word.’ —<i>Deeds of
Beowulf</i>, pp. xix, xx.
</blockquote>


<h5>The Text of 1835. Kemble’s Scholarship.</h5>

<p>But whatever may be said of the text of 1833, there is nothing but
praise for the edition of 1835. In this book

the poem first had the advantage of a modern scholarly treatment, and
for the first time the text of the MS. was correctly transcribed. It
received its first punctuation. For the first time it was properly
divided into half-lines, with attention to alliteration. The text was
freely emended, but the suggested readings were placed in the footnotes,
in order not to impair the value of the text as a reproduction of the
MS. The necessity for this was made evident by Kemble
himself:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘But while he makes the necessary corrections, no man is justified in
withholding the original readings: for although the laws of a language,
ascertained by wide and careful examination of all the cognate tongues,
of the hidden springs and ground-principles upon which they rest in
common, are like the laws of the Medes and Persians and alter not, yet
the very errors of the old writer are valuable, and serve sometimes as
guides and clues to the inner being and spiritual tendencies of the
language itself. The reader will moreover be spared that, to some
people, heart-burning necessity of taking his editor’s qualifications
too much for granted, if side by side he is allowed to judge of the
traditional error, and the proposed correction. I have endeavoured
to accomplish this end by printing the text, letter for letter, as I
found it.’ —Preface, pp. xxiv ff.
</blockquote>

<p>With this wholesome respect for the tradition of the MS., it is not
strange that Kemble’s carefully chosen emendations should stand to-day
as of high critical value, and that many of them are retained in modern
editions of the text<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble1" id="tag_kemble1" href="#note_kemble1">1</a>. When we compare Kemble’s
book with Thorkelin’s, the advance is seen to be little less than
astonishing. Thorkelin’s emendations were worse than useless.</p>

<p>Kemble had a full acquaintance with the new science of comparative
philology which was developing in Germany under Jakob Grimm. He had
corresponded, and later studied, with Grimm, and, according to William
Hunt, was the ‘recognised exponent’ of his investigations<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble2" id="tag_kemble2" href="#note_kemble2">2</a>. It is to

Grimm that Kemble dedicates his volumes, and to him that he repeatedly
acknowledges his indebtedness. Thus Kemble brought to the study of the
poem not only a knowledge of the Old English poetry and prose, but
acquaintance with Old Norse, Gothic, Old High German, and Old Saxon. It
may sufficiently illustrate his scholarly method to instance examples of
his treatment of the unique words in <i>Beowulf</i>. Take, e.g., the
word <i>hose</i> in line 924. This word does not appear elsewhere in Old
English; it does not appear in Lye’s <i>Dictionary</i>, the only
dictionary that was at Kemble’s disposal. Upon this word Kemble brought
to bear his knowledge of the Germanic tongues, and by citing Goth.
<i>hansa</i>, OHG. <i>hansa</i>, &amp;c., derived the meaning
<i>turma</i>—a process in which he is supported by a modern
authority like Kluge. The study of compounds also first began with
Kemble. He collected and compared the compounds in <i>heaðo.</i>. Thus
he laid the foundation of all modern studies on the Old English
compound.</p>


<h5>Further Critical Material Afforded by the Volume of 1837.</h5>

<p>In the 1835 volume twenty-three words were illustrated in the above
way. But it remained for the 1837 volume to present a complete glossary
of the poem, containing also important poetic words not in
<i>Beowulf</i>. By reason of its completeness and comparative work, it
remained the standard commentary on the Old English poetic vocabulary
until the appearance of Grein’s <i>Sprachschatz</i><a class="tag" name="tag_kemble3" id="tag_kemble3" href="#note_kemble3">3</a>.</p>


<h5>Aim of Kemble’s Translation.</h5>

<p>Like his edition of the text, Kemble’s translation is quite
independent of any preceding book; like his edition of the text, its aim
was faithfulness to the original. He adheres scrupulously to the text,
save where the original

is unintelligible. The translation was designed to be used together with
the glossary as a part of the apparatus for interpreting the poem. He
therefore made it strictly literal.</p>

<blockquote>
‘The translation is a literal one; I was bound to give, word for word,
the original in all its roughness: I might have made it smoother,
but I purposely avoided doing so, because had the Saxon poet thought as
we think, and expressed his thoughts as we express our thoughts,
I might have spared myself the trouble of editing or translating
his poem. A few transpositions of words, &amp;c. caused principally
by the want of inflections in New English (since we have now little more
than their position by which to express the relations of words to one
another) are all that I have allowed myself, and where I have inserted
words I have generally printed them in italics.’ —

            <div class="mb-3"><h5 class="smallroman">VIII.</h5>

<blockquote>
Hunferth the son of Eglaf spake, <i>he</i> that sat at the feet of the
Lord of the Scyldings; he bound up<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble4" id="tag_kemble4" href="#note_kemble4">4</a> a quarrelsome
speech: to him was the journey of Beowulf, the proud sea-farer,
a great disgust; because he granted not that any other man should
ever have beneath the skies, more reputation with the world than he
himself: ‘Art thou the Beowulf that didst contend with Brecca on the
wide sea, in a swimming match, where ye for pride explored the fords,
and out of vain glory ventured your lives upon the deep water? nor might
any man, friend or foe, blame<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble5" id="tag_kemble5" href="#note_kemble5">5</a> your sorrowful expedition:
there ye rowed upon the sea, there ye two covered the ocean-stream with
your arms, measured the sea-streets, whirled them with your hands,
glided over the ocean; with the waves of the deep<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble6" id="tag_kemble6" href="#note_kemble6">6</a> the fury
of winter boiled; ye two on the realms of water laboured for a week: he
overcame thee in swimming, he had more strength: then at the morning
tide the deep sea bore him up on Hēathoræmes, whence he sought his own
paternal land, dear to his people, the land of the Brondings, where he
owned

a nation, a town, and rings. All his promise to thee, the son
of Beanstan truly performed.’
</blockquote></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><p>Kemble’s scholarship enabled him to get a full understanding of the
poem, and thus to make the first really adequate translation of
<i>Beowulf</i>. He was the first to recognize the significance of
kenning, metaphor, and compound. Thus his work is to be commended
chiefly because of its faithfulness. All preceding studies had been
wofully inaccurate<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble7" id="tag_kemble7" href="#note_kemble7">7</a>. Kemble’s editions became at
once the authoritative commentary on the text, and held this position
until the appearance of Grein’s <i>Bibliothek</i> (1857). In this latter
book, Kemble’s text was the principal authority used in correcting the
work of Thorpe<a class="tag" name="tag_kemble8" id="tag_kemble8" href="#note_kemble8">8</a>. In spite of the fact that this is a
literal translation, it sometimes attains strength and beauty by reason
of its very simplicity.</p></div>
