              <p>
                The volume had its origin in the Terminal Lectures which the
                author gave as Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Poetry at Oxford
                from 1809 to 1812<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_conybeare1"
                  id="tag_conybeare1"
                  href="#note_conybeare1"
                  >1</a
                >. We know from an autobiographical note printed in the
                Introduction<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_conybeare2"
                  id="tag_conybeare2"
                  href="#note_conybeare2"

                >
                that the <i>Beowulf</i> was finished in October, 1820. But the
                book did not appear until two years after the author’s death,
                and the material which it contains is of a slightly earlier date
                than the title-page would seem to indicate—e.g. the volume
                really antedates the third edition of Turner’s History discussed
                above<a
                  class="tag"
                  name="tag_conybeare3"
                  id="tag_conybeare3"
                  href="#note_conybeare3"

                Conybeare, and the Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem.
              </h5>

              <p>
                Conybeare did not edit the entire poem, and apparently never had
                any intention of so doing. The selections which he translates
                are based on Thorkelin’s text. He revises this text, however, in
                making his translations, and even incorporates a collation of
                Thorkelin’s text with the MS. (pp. 137–55). This collation,
                though not complete or accurate, was serviceable, and kept
                Conybeare from falling into some of the errors that the
                Icelander had made. He distinguished by an asterisk the MS.
                readings which were of material importance in giving the sense
                of a passage, and, in fact, constructed for himself a text that
                was practically new.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                ‘The text has been throughout carefully collated with the
                original Manuscript, and the translation of Thorkelin revised
                with all the diligence of which the editor is capable.’ —Page
                32.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                ‘Any attempt to restore the metre, and to correct the version
                throughout, would have exceeded the bounds, and involved much
                discussion foreign to the purpose of the present work. This must
                be left to the labours of the Saxon scholar. It is evident,
                however, that without a more correct text than that of
                Thorkelin, those labours must be hopeless. The wish of supplying
                that deficiency, may perhaps apologize for the occupying, by
                this Collation, so large a space of a work strictly dedicated to
                other purposes.’ —Page 137, footnote.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                How much Conybeare improved the text may be seen by comparing
                his text and Latin translation with those of Thorkelin. The
                first six lines of the Prolog follow:—

              <p>
                It will be seen that in these lines Conybeare has at almost
                every point the advantage over Thorkelin, and is indeed very
                nearly in accord with modern texts and translations. But the
                poem yet awaited a complete understanding, for Conybeare could
                say: ‘The Introduction is occupied by the praises of Scefing . .
                . and of his son and successor Beowulf. The embarkation of the
                former on a piratical expedition is then detailed at some
                length. In this expedition (if I rightly understand the text)
                himself and his companions were taken or lost at sea’ (p. 35).
                And, in general, he misses the same points of the story as
                Thorkelin, although he craftily refrains from translating the
                obscurer passages.
              </p>

              <p>
                Conybeare apparently knew nothing of the critical work of
                Grundtvig. This is not surprising when we remember that
                <i>Kjøbenhavns Skilderie</i> was probably not known outside of
                Denmark<a

                  >4</a
                >. Moreover, it is to be remembered that Conybeare’s extracts
                from the <i>Beowulf</i> are not really later than Grundtvig’s
                translation, since they were made in the same year, 1820<a

              <h5>Aim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translations.</h5>

              <p>
                From the words quoted above with respect to the collation, it
                will be seen that Conybeare in no way regarded his book as a
                contribution to Beowulf scholarship. As professor at Oxford, he
                attempted a literary presentation of the most beautiful parts of
                the old poetry. His extracts are, in general, nothing more than
                free paraphrases. Wishing to popularize the <i>Beowulf</i>, he
                used as a medium of translation a peculiarly stilted kind of
                blank verse. He dressed the poem out in elegant phrases in order
                to hide the barrenness of the original. Manifestly he feared the
                roughness, the remoteness of the poem in its natural state. He
                feared to offend a nation of readers reveling in the medievalism
                of Scott and Byron. A literal Latin translation was inserted to
                appease the scholar.

                The English version is scarcely more than a paraphrase, as may
                easily be seen by comparing it with the literal translation into
                Latin. But even as a paraphrase it is unsatisfactory. By way of
                general criticism it may be said that, while it attains a kind
                of dignity, it is not the dignity of <i>Beowulf</i>, for it is
                self-conscious. Like <i>Beowulf</i> it is elaborate, but it is
                the elaboration of art rather than of feeling. Moreover, it is
                freighted with Miltonic phrase, and constantly suggests the
                Miltonic movement. The trick of verse in line 3 is quite too
                exquisite for <i>Beowulf</i>. The whole piece has a straining
                after pomp and majesty that is utterly foreign to the simple,
                often baldly simple, ideas and phrases of the original. Nearly
                every adjective is supplied by the translator: in Old English
                the ‘sword’ is ‘bloody,’ in Conybeare the ‘gallant sword drops
                fast a gory dew’; the cave becomes a mansion; the ‘floor’ is
                ‘dust’—dust in an ocean cave!—‘heaven’s candle’ becomes
                ‘heaven’s glorious torch.’ The poem is tricked out almost beyond
                recognition. Beowulf assumes the ‘grand manner,’ and paces ‘the
                Grendel’s hold’ like one of the strutting emperors of Dryden’s
                elaborate drama.
