<p>In the second edition a title-page is added. The running commentary,
printed in rubric on the margin of the first edition, is omitted.</p>


<h5>Text Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is, in general, conformed to Wyatt’s text of 1894,
departing from it in only a few unimportant details.</p>


<h5>Part Taken in the Work by Morris and Wyatt respectively.</h5>

<p>The matter is fortunately made perfectly clear in Mackail’s <i>Life
of William Morris</i>, vol. ii. p. 284:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘(Morris) was not an Anglo-Saxon scholar, and to help him in following
the original, he used the aid of a prose translation made for him by Mr.
A. J. Wyatt, of Christ’s College, Cambridge, with whom he had also read
through the original. The plan of their joint

labours had been settled in the autumn of 1892. Mr. Wyatt began to
supply Morris with his prose paraphrase in February, 1893, and he at
once began to “rhyme up,” as he said, “very eager to be at it, finding
it the most delightful work.” He was working at it all through the year,
and used to read it to Burne-Jones regularly on Sunday mornings in
summer.’
</blockquote>

<p>The plan of joining with his own the name of his principal teacher
was one which Morris had used before when translating from a foreign
tongue. He published his rendering of the <i>Volsunga Saga</i> as the
work of ‘Eirikr Magnússon and William Morris.’ There is no evidence that
Mr. Wyatt had any hand in forming the final draft of the translation. In
defending it, Morris took all the responsibility for the book upon
himself, and he always spoke of it as his own work. In writing to a
German student toward the end of his life Morris spoke of the
translation as his own without mentioning Mr. Wyatt<a class="tag" name="tag_morris_wyatt1" id="tag_morris_wyatt1" href="#note_morris_wyatt1">1</a>. Nor has Mr. Wyatt shown a disposition to
claim a share in the work. In the preface to his edition of the text of
<i>Beowulf</i> (Cambridge, 1894), he says:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘Mr. William Morris has taken the text of this edition as the basis of
his modern metrical rendering of the lay.’ —Page xiii.
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, it may be added that the specimens of Mr. Wyatt’s
translation printed in the glossary and notes of his book bear no
resemblance to the work of Morris.</p>


<h5>Morris’s Theory of Translation.</h5>

<p>None despised the merely literal rendering of an epic poem more than
William Morris. In writing of his version of the <i>Odyssey</i> to
Ellis, Morris said: ‘My translation is a real one so far, not a mere
periphrase of the original as <i>all</i> the others are.’ In translating
an ancient poem, he tried to reproduce the simplicity and remoteness of
phrase which he found in his original. He believed it possible,

e.g., to suggest the archaic flavor of Homer by adopting a diction that
bore the same relation to modern English that the language of Homer bore
to that of the age of Pericles. The archaism of the English would
represent the archaism of the Greek. This method he used in rendering
Vergil and Homer.</p>

<p>But when he approached the translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, he was
confronted by a new problem. It was evident that fifteenth-century
English was ill-adapted to convey any just notion of eighth-century
English. <i>Beowulf</i> required a diction older than that of Sir Thomas
Malory or Chaucer. Hence it became necessary to discard the theory
altogether, or else to produce another style which should in some true
sense be imitative of <i>Beowulf</i>. This latter Morris tried to
accomplish by increasing the archaism of his style by every means in his
power. This feature is discussed in the following section.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation of <i>Beowulf</i> is written in extremely archaic
language. An imitative measure of four principal stresses is used.
Wherever possible, the Old English syntax has been preserved (see line
1242); the word-order of the original is retained. The archaic language
is wrought of several different kinds of words. In the first place,
there is the ‘legitimate archaism,’ such as ‘mickle,’ ‘burg,’ ‘bairn’;
there are forms which are more closely associated with the translation
of Old English, such as ‘middle-garth,’ ‘ring-stem.’ There are modern
words used with the old signification, such as ‘kindly’ (in the sense
‘of the same kind’), ‘won war’ (in the sense ‘wage war’), ‘fret’ (in the
sense ‘eat’). Finally, there are forms which are literally translated
from Old English: ‘the sight seen once only’ from <i>ansȳn</i>, face,
251; ‘spearman’ from <i>garsecg</i>, ocean (see extract), ‘gift-scat’
from <i>gif-sceatt</i>, gift of money,

378; ‘the Maker’s own making’ from <i>metod-sceaft</i>, doom, 1180.
Romance words are excluded whenever possible. A glossary of ‘some
words not commonly used now’ is included in the book, but none of the
words cited above, save ‘burg,’ is found in it.</p></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><h5 class="smallcaps">IX. Unferth contendeth in words with
Beowulf.</h5>

<div class="verse lines">
<p class="indent">
Spake out then Unferth that bairn was of Ecglaf,</p>
<span class="linenum">500</span>
<p>And he sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,</p>
<p>He unbound the battle-rune; was Beowulf’s faring,</p>
<p>Of him the proud mere-farer, mickle unliking,</p>
<p>Whereas he begrudg’d it of any man other</p>
<p>That he glories more mighty the middle-garth over</p>
<p>Should hold under heaven than he himself held:</p>
<p class="indent">
Art thou that Beowulf who won strife with Breca</p>
<p>On the wide sea contending in swimming,</p>
<p>When ye two for pride’s sake search’d out the floods</p>
<p>And for a dolt’s cry into deep water</p>
<span class="linenum">510</span>
<p>Thrust both your life-days? No man the twain of you,</p>
<p>Lief or loth were he, might lay wyte to stay you</p>
<p>Your sorrowful journey, when on the sea row’d ye;</p>
<p>Then when the ocean-stream ye with your arms deck’d,</p>
<p>Meted the mere-streets, there your hands brandish’d!</p>
<p>O’er the Spearman ye glided; the sea with waves welter’d,</p>
<p>The surge of the winter. Ye twain in the waves’ might</p>
<p>For a seven nights swink’d. He outdid thee in swimming,</p>
<p>And the more was his might; but him in the morn-tide</p>
<p>To the Heatho-Remes’ land the holm bore ashore,</p>
<span class="linenum">520</span>
<p>And thence away sought he to his dear land and lovely,</p>
<p>The lief to his people sought the land of the Brondings,</p>
<p>The fair burg peace-warding, where he the folk owned,</p>
<p>The burg and the gold rings. What to theeward he boasted,</p>
<p>Beanstan’s son, for thee soothly he brought it about.</p>
</div></div>
            <div class="mb-3"><p>The Morris-Wyatt translation is thoroughly accurate, and is, so to
speak, an official commentary on the text

of Wyatt’s edition. It is therefore of importance to the student of the
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>As a literary rendering the translation is disappointing. In the
first place, it must be frankly avowed that the diction is frequently so
strange that it seems to modern readers well-nigh ridiculous. There are
certain sentences which cannot but evoke a smile. Such are:
‘(he) spoke a word backward,’ line 315; ‘them that in Scaney dealt
out the scat,’ line 1686.</p>

<p>Secondly, the translation is unreadable. There is an avalanche of
archaisms. One example of the extreme obscurity may be given:—</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>‘Then rathe was beroom’d, as the rich one was bidding,</p>
<p>For the guests a-foot going the floor all withinward.’</p>
</div>

<p class="page">
l. 1975–76.</p>

<p>It would seem that the burden of ‘rathe,’ ‘beroomed,’ and
‘withinward,’ were sufficient for any sentence to carry, but we are left
to discover for ourselves that ‘rich one’ does not mean rich one, but
ruler, that the ‘floor’ is not a floor but a hall, and that the guests
are not guests, but the ruler’s own men.</p>

<p>Morris himself was conscious of the obscurity of the work:—</p>

<blockquote>
‘For the language of his version Morris once felt it necessary to make
an apology. Except a few words, he said, the words used in it were such
as he would not hesitate to use in an original poem of his own. He did
not add, however, that their effect, if slipped sparingly in amid his
own pellucid construction and facile narrative method, would be very
different from their habitual use in a translation. . . .
As the work advanced, he seems to have felt this himself, and his
pleasure in the doing of it fell off.’ —Mackail’s <i>Life</i>, ii.
284–5.
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the version does not <i>translate</i>. Words like ‘Spearman’
for <i>Ocean</i>, and combinations like ‘the sight seen once only’ for
<i>the face</i>, can be understood only by the intimate student of Old
English poetry, and there is no reason why such a person should not
peruse <i>Beowulf</i> in

the original tongue rather than in a translation occasionally as obscure
as the poem itself.</p>

<p>If one can peer through the darkness of Morris’s diction, he will
discover a fairly pleasing use of the so-called imitative measure. The
verse is not nearly so rough as the original; many of the characteristic
substitutions are avoided. There is evident a tendency toward the
‘rising verse’ and the anapestic foot. The feminine ending is frequently
used. The verse is, therefore, not strictly imitative in that it retains
the Old English system of versification, but rather in that it attempts
to suggest the Old English movement by the use of four principal
stresses and a varying number of unstressed syllables. Morris’s verse is
the best of all the ‘imitative’ measures.</p></div>
