The `beowulf-s` project started by parsing the content of Chauncey B. Tinker, *The Translations of Beowulf: A Critical Bibliography* 1903 into tabular metadata.
Tinker's work is a list of translations of Beowulf with introductions, extracts, and criticism.
The contents were refined and enhanced with links to digitized editions of the works.
Beowulf-s was inspired by reading [Maria Dahvana Headley's introduction in *Beowulf: a New Translation* 2020](https://us.macmillan.com/excerpt?isbn=9780374720155).
