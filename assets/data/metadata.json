        "introduction": "<p>The unique manuscript of the\n<i>Beowulf</i> is preserved in the Cottonian Library of the British\nMuseum. It is contained in the folio designated Cotton Vitellius A. xv,\nwhere it occurs ninth in order, filling the folios numbered 129a to\n198b, inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>The first recorded notice of the MS. is to be found in Wanley’s\nCatalog of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts (Oxford, 1705), Volume III of\nHickes’s <i>Thesaurus</i>. The poem is thus described:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Tractatus nobilissimus Poeticè scriptus. Præfationis hoc est initium.’\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first nineteen lines follow, transcribed with a few errors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Initium autem primi Capitis sic se habet.’\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lines 53–73, transcribed with a few errors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘In hoc libro, qui Poeseos Anglo-Saxonicæ egregium est exemplum,\ndescripta videntur bella quæ Beowulfus quidam Danus, ex Regio\nScyldingorum stirpe Ortus, gessit contra Sueciæ Regulos.’ Page 218, col.\nb, and 219, col.&nbsp;a.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No further notice was taken of the MS. until 1786, when Thorkelin<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_prelim1\" id=\"tag_prelim1\" href=\"#note_prelim1\">1</a> made two transcripts of&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<p>In 1731 there occurred a disastrous fire which destroyed a number of\nthe Cottonian MSS. The Beowulf MS. suffered at this time, its edges\nbeing scorched and its pages shriveled. As a result, the edges have\nchipped away, and some of the readings have been lost. It does not appear,\nhowever, that these losses are of so great importance as the remarks of\nsome prominent Old English scholars might lead us to suspect. Their\nremarks give the impression that the injury which the MS. received in\nthe fire accounts for practically all of the illegible lines. That this\nis not so may be seen by comparing the Wanley transcript with the\nZupitza <i>Autotypes</i>. Writing in 1705, before the Cotton fire,\nWanley found two illegible words at line 15—illegible because of\nfading and rubbing. Of exactly the same nature appear to be the injuries\nat lines 2220&nbsp;ff., the celebrated passage which is nearly, if not\nquite, unintelligible. It would therefore be a safe assumption that such\ninjuries as these happened to the MS. before it became a part of the\nvolume, Vitellius A. xv. The injuries due to scorching and burning are\nseldom of the first importance.</p>\n\n<p>This point is worth noting. Each succeeding scholar who transcribed\nthe MS., eager to recommend his work, dwelt upon the rapid deterioration\nof the parchment, and the reliability of his own readings as exact\nreproductions of what he himself had seen in the MS. before it reached\nits present ruinous state. The result of this was that the emendations\nof the editor were sometimes accepted by scholars and translators as the\nauthoritative readings of the MS., when in reality they were nothing but\ngratuitous additions. This is especially true of Thorpe<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_prelim2\" id=\"tag_prelim2\" href=\"#note_prelim2\">2</a>,\nand the false readings which he introduced were never got rid of until\nthe Zupitza <i>Autotypes</i> brought to light the sins of the various\neditors of the poem. These statements regarding text and MS. will be\ndeveloped in the following sections of the paper<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_prelim3\" id=\"tag_prelim3\" href=\"#note_prelim3\">3</a>.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Points of Difference between the Various Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>A part of this may be stated in the words of the author:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The poem had remained untouched and unnoticed both here and abroad\nuntil I observed its curious contents, and in 1805 announced it to the\npublic. I could then give it only a hasty perusal, and from the MS.\nhaving a leaf interposed near its commencement, which belonged to a\nsubsequent part, and from the peculiar obscurity which sometimes attends\nthe Saxon poetry, I did not at that time sufficiently comprehend\nit, and had not leisure to apply a closer attention. But in the year\n1818 I took it up again, as I was preparing my third edition, and then\nmade that more correct analysis which was inserted in that and the\nsubsequent editions, and which is also exhibited in the present.’\n—Sixth edition, p. 293, footnote.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>The statement that the poem had remained untouched and unnoticed is\nnot strictly true. The public had not yet received any detailed\ninformation regarding it; but Wanley<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner1\" id=\"tag_turner1\" href=\"#note_turner1\">1</a> had\nmentioned the <i>Beowulf</i> in his catalog, and Thorkelin had already\nmade two transcripts of the poem, and was at work upon an edition.\nTurner, however, deserves full credit for first calling the attention of\nthe English people to the importance of the poem.</p>\n\n<p>In the third edition, of which the author speaks, many improvements\nwere introduced into the digest of the story and some improvements into\nthe text of the translations. Many of these were gleaned from the\n<i>editio princeps</i> of Thorkelin<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner2\" id=\"tag_turner2\" href=\"#note_turner2\">2</a>. The story is now told\nwith a fair degree of accuracy, although many serious errors remain:\ne.g. the author did not distinguish the correct interpretation of the\nswimming-match, an extract of which is given below. The translations are\nabout as faulty as ever, as may be seen by comparing the two extracts.\nIn the first edition only the first part of the poem is treated; in the\nthird, selections from the second part are added.</p>\n\n<p>No further changes were made in later editions of the History.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed information regarding differences between the first three\neditions may be found below.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Turner, and his Knowledge of Old English.</h5>\n\n<p>Sharon Turner (1768–1847) was from early youth devoted to the\nstudy of Anglo-Saxon history, literature, and antiquities. His knowledge\nwas largely derived from the examination of original documents in the\nBritish Museum<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner3\" id=\"tag_turner3\" href=\"#note_turner3\">3</a>. But the very wealth of the new material\nwhich he found for the study of the literature kept him from making a\nthorough study of it. It is to be remembered\n\nthat at this time but little was known of the peculiar nature of the Old\nEnglish poetry. Turner gives fair discussions of the works of Bede and\nÆlfric, but he knows practically nothing of the poetry. With the\nso-called <i>Paraphrase</i> of Cædmon he is, of course, familiar; but\nhis knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Judith</i> is derived from the\nunique, and at that time (1805) unpublished, MS., Cotton Vitellius A.\nxv. Of the contents of the Exeter Book he knew nothing. The Vercelli\nBook had not yet been discovered. The materials at hand for his study\nwere a faulty edition of Cædmon and an insufficient dictionary. The\nauthor, whose interest was of course primarily in history, was not\nfamiliar with the linguistic work of the day. It is, therefore, not\nsurprising that his work was not of the best quality.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Lines in the Poem Translated by Turner.</h5>\n\n<p>First edition: 18–40; 47–83a; 199b-279; 320–324;\n333–336; 499–517a. In the second edition are added:\n1–17; 41–46; 83b-114; 189–199a; 387–497;\n522–528. In the third edition are added: 529–531;\n535–558; 607–646; 671–674; 720–738;\n991–996; 1013–1042; 1060b-1068a; 1159b-1165a; 1168b-1180a;\n1215b-1226a; 1240b-1246a; and a few other detached lines.</p>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_turner_account\" id=\"trans_turner_account\">\nTurner’s Account of Beowulf in the First Edition of his\nHistory.</a></h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The most interesting remains of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which time has\nsuffered to reach us, are contained in the Anglo-Saxon poem in the\nCotton Library, Vitellius A. 15. Wanley mentions it as a poem in which\n“seem to be described the wars which one Beowulf, a Dane of the\nroyal race of the Scyldingi, waged against the reguli of Sweden<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner4\" id=\"tag_turner4\" href=\"#note_turner4\">4</a>.” But this account of the contents of the MS. is\nincorrect. It is a composition more curious and important. It is a\nnarration of the attempt\n\nof Beowulf to wreck the fæthe or deadly feud on Hrothgar, for a homicide\nwhich he had committed. It may be called an Anglo-Saxon epic poem. It\nabounds with speeches which Beowulf and Hrothgar and their partisans\nmake to each other, with much occasional description and sentiment.’\n—Book vi, chap. iv, pp. 398 ff.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h5>The Story of the Poem as Interpreted by Turner.</h5>\n\n<p>‘It begins with a proemium, which introduces its hero Beowulf to our\nnotice. . . . The poet then states the embarkation of\nBeowulf and his partisans. . . .’ Turner interprets the\nprolog as the description of the embarkation of Beowulf on a piratical\nexpedition. The accession of Hrothgar to the throne of the Danes is then\ndescribed, and the account of his ‘homicide’ is given. This remarkable\nmistake was caused by the transposition of a sheet from a later part of\nthe poem—the fight with Grendel—to the first section of the\npoem. The sailing of Beowulf and the arrival in the Danish land are then\ngiven. Turner continues: ‘The sixth section exhibits Hrothgar’s\nconversation with his nobles, and Beowulf’s introduction and address to\nhim. The seventh section opens with Hrothgar’s answer to him, who\nendeavours to explain the circumstance of the provocation. In the eighth\nsection a new speaker appears, who is introduced, as almost all the\npersonages in the poem are mentioned, with some account of his parentage\nand character.’ Then follows the extract given below.</p>",
        "extract": "<div class=\"verse\">\n<p><span class=\"firstword\">Hunferth</span> spoke</p>\n<p>The son of Ecglafe;</p>\n<p>Who had sat at the foot</p>\n<p>Of the lord of the Scyldingi</p>\n<p>Among the band of the battle mystery.</p>\n<p>To go in the path of Beowulf</p>\n<p>Was to him a great pride;</p>\n<p>He was zealous</p>\n<p>That to him it should be granted</p>\n<p>That no other man</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">\nWas esteemed greater in the world</p>\n<p>Under the heavens than himself.</p>\n<p class=\"indent\">\n‘Art thou Beowulf</p>\n<p>He that with such profit</p>\n<p>Dwells in the expansive sea,</p>\n<p>Amid the contests of the ocean?</p>\n<p>There yet<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner5\" id=\"tag_turner5\" href=\"#note_turner5\">5</a> for riches go!</p>\n<p>You try for deceitful glory</p>\n<p>In deep waters<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner6\" id=\"tag_turner6\" href=\"#note_turner6\">6</a>.—</p>\n<p>Nor can any man,</p>\n<p>Whether dear or odious,</p>\n<p>Restrain you from the sorrowful path—</p>\n<p>There yet<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner7\" id=\"tag_turner7\" href=\"#note_turner7\">7</a> with eye-streams</p>\n<p>To the miserable you<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner8\" id=\"tag_turner8\" href=\"#note_turner8\">8</a> flourish:</p>\n<p>You meet in the sea-street;</p>\n<p>You oppress with your hands;</p>\n<p><a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_turner9\" id=\"tag_turner9\" href=\"#note_turner9\">9</a>You glide over the ocean’s waves;</p>\n<p>The fury of winter rages,</p>\n<p>Yet on the watery domain</p>\n<p>Seven nights have ye toiled.’</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>After this extract, Turner continues:— ‘It would occupy too\nmuch room in the present volume to give a further account of this\ninteresting poem, which well deserves to be submitted to the public,\nwith a translation and with ample notes. There are forty-two sections of\nit in the Cotton MS., and it ends there imperfectly. It is perhaps the\noldest poem of an epic form in the vernacular language of Europe which\nnow exists.’</p>\n\n\n<p>In the second edition the following lines were added:—</p>\n\n<p>‘After Hunferthe, another character is introduced:</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>Dear to his people,</p>\n<p>of the land of the Brondingi;</p>\n<p>the Lord of fair cities,</p>\n<p>where he had people,</p>\n<p>barks, and bracelets,</p>\n<p>Ealwith, the son of Beandane,</p>\n<p>the faithful companion</p>\n<p>menaced.</p>\n<p class=\"indent\">\n“Then I think</p>\n<p>worse things will be to thee,</p>\n<p>thou noble one!</p>\n<p>Every where the rush</p>\n<p>of grim battle will be made.</p>\n<p>If thou darest the grendles,</p>\n<p>the time of a long night</p>\n<p>will be near to thee.”’</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_turner_third\" id=\"trans_turner_third\">\nThird Edition.</a></h5>\n\n<p>‘Hunferth, “the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the lord of the\nScyldingi.” He is described as jealous of Beowulf’s reputation, and as\nrefusing to any man more celebrity than himself. He is represented as\ntaunting Beowulf on his exploits as a sea-king or vikingr.</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p class=\"indent\">\n“Art thou Beowulf,</p>\n<p>he that with such profit</p>\n<p>labours on the wide sea,</p>\n<p>amid the contests of the ocean?</p>\n<p>There you for riches,</p>\n<p>and for deceitful glory,</p>\n<p>explore its bays</p>\n<p>in the deep waters,</p>\n<p>till you sleep with your elders.</p>\n<p>Nor can any man restrain you,</p>\n<p>whether dear or odious to you,</p>\n<p>from this sorrowful path.</p>\n<p>There you rush on the wave;</p>\n<p>there on the water streams:</p>\n\n<p>from the miserable you flourish.</p>\n<p>You place yourselves in the sea-street;</p>\n<p>you oppress with your hands;</p>\n<p>you glide over the ocean</p>\n<p>through the waves of its seas.</p>\n<p>The fury of the winter rages,</p>\n<p>yet on the watery domain</p>\n<p>seven nights have ye toiled.”’</p>\n</div>",
        "criticism": "<p>Detailed criticism of the extracts is unnecessary. They are, of\ncourse, utterly useless to-day. Sufficient general criticism of the work\nis found in the preceding sections devoted to a discussion of the author\nand his knowledge of Old English and of the <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>\n\n<p>In the third edition the author presents some criticisms of\nThorkelin’s text; but his own work is quite as faulty as the\nIcelander’s, and his ‘corrections’ are often misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Turner is to be censured for allowing an account of <i>Beowulf</i> so\nfull of inaccuracy to be reprinted year after year with no attempt at\nits improvement or even a warning to the public that it had been\nsuperseded by later and more scholarly studies.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>\n\n<p>The words of Wanley cited above<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorkelin1\" id=\"tag_thorkelin1\" href=\"#note_thorkelin1\">1</a>\ndid not pass unnoticed in Denmark. Thorkelin tells us in his\nintroduction that it had long been the desire of Suhm<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorkelin2\" id=\"tag_thorkelin2\" href=\"#note_thorkelin2\">2</a>, Langebeck, Magnusen, and other Danish scholars\nto inspect the MS. in the British Museum. The following is Thorkelin’s\naccount of his editorial labors:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Via tandem mihi data fuit ad desideratum nimis diu divini vatis Danici\nincomparabile opus. Arcta etenim, quæ nos et Britannos intercessit\namicitia, me allexit, ut, clementissime annuentibus Augustissimis patriæ\npatribus <span class=\"smallcaps\">Christiano VII.</span> et <span class=\"smallcaps\">Frederico VI.</span> iter in Britanniam anno seculi\npræteriti <span class=\"smallroman\">LXXXVI</span>. ad thesauros\nbibliothecarum Albionensium perscrutandos facerem. . . .\nA curatoribus, Musæi Britannici, aliarumque Bibliothecarum,\npotestas mihi data [est] inspiciendi, tractandi, et exscribendi omnia,\nquæ rebus Danicis lucem affere possent manuscripta. Ad quam rem\nconficiendam viri nostro præconio majores Josephus Planta et Richardus\nSouthgate dicti Musæi Brit. præfecti in me sua officia humanissime\ncontulerunt. Optimo igitur successu et uberrimo cum fructu domum\nreversus sum . . .’ (pp. viii, ix).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thorkelin thus obtained two copies of the poem, one made with his own\nhand, the other by a scribe ignorant of Old English. These transcripts\n(still preserved in Copenhagen) formed the basis for Thorkelin’s\nedition. The account of his studies continues:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Quæcunque igitur possent hoc meum negotium adjuvare, comparare coepi,\nmagnamque librorum copiam unde quaque congessi, quorum opera carmen\naggrederer. In hoc me sedulum ita gessi, ut opus totum anno <span class=\"smallroman\">MDCCCVII</span> confecerim, idem brevi\nediturus . . .’ (p. xv).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just at this time, unfortunately, Copenhagen was stormed by the\nEnglish fleet, and Thorkelin’s text and notes were\n\nburned with his library. But the transcripts were saved. Thorkelin\nrenewed his labors under the patronage of Bülow, and at length published\nin 1815.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Thorkelin, and his Interpretation of the Beowulf.</h5>\n\n<p>Grimus Johnssen Thorkelin (or Thorkelsson), 1752–1829, is\nremembered as a scholar in early Germanic history. He had little beside\nthis knowledge and his general acquaintance with Old Germanic languages\nto recommend him as an editor of the <i>Beowulf</i>. Grundtvig said that\nthe transcript of the <i>Beowulf</i> must have been the work of one\nwholly ignorant of Old English<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorkelin3\" id=\"tag_thorkelin3\" href=\"#note_thorkelin3\">3</a>. Thorkelin knew\nnothing of the peculiar style of Old English poetry; he could recognize\nneither kenning, metaphor, nor compound. He was not even fitted to\nundertake the transcription of the text, as the following section will\nmake evident.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen how Sharon Turner<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorkelin4\" id=\"tag_thorkelin4\" href=\"#note_thorkelin4\">4</a>\ncould describe the <i>Beowulf</i>. Thorkelin seems to have been little\nbetter fitted to understand the poem, to say nothing of editing it. He\nfailed to interpret some of the simplest events of the story. He did not\nidentify Scyld, nor understand that his body was given up to the sea,\nbut thought that King Beowulf ‘expeditionem suscipit navalem.’ He failed\nto identify Breca, and thought that Hunferth was describing some\npiratical voyage of Beowulf’s. He makes Beowulf reply that ‘piratas\nubique persequitur et fudit,’ and ‘Finlandiæ arma infert<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorkelin5\" id=\"tag_thorkelin5\" href=\"#note_thorkelin5\">5</a>.’ He regarded Beowulf as the hero of the\nSigemund episode.

He misread words and letters of the MS., although\nhe had two transcripts. He dropped letters, combinations of letters, and\neven whole words. He joined words that had no relation to each other; he\nbroke words into two or even three parts; he ignored compounds. He\nproduced many forms the like of which cannot be found in Old English.\nOne further example of his great carelessness may be given. The first\nline of the poem, which is written in large capitals in\nthe MS.:—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nHwæt we Gardena. . . .</p>\n\n<p>Thorkelin perversely transcribed:—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nHwæt wegar Dena. . . .</p>\n\n<p>and for this combination of syllables he chose the\ntranslation:—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nQuomodo Danorum.</p>\n\n<p>There is, of course, no such word as ‘wegar’ in Old English.</p>\n\n<p>Of the necessity of punctuation Thorkelin seems to have been serenely\nunconscious; he did not even follow the guides afforded by the MS. Had\nhe done so, he would have saved himself many humiliating errors. For\nexample, in the text given above, to have noticed the periods mentioned\nin the collation would have been to avoid two glaring instances of\n‘running-in.’</p>\n\n\n<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>But, in spite of the wretched text, it remained for the translation\nto discover the depths of Thorkelin’s ignorance. It will be seen by\nreading the extract given from the\n\ntranslation that he did not even perceive that two men were swimming in\nthe sea. It is to be remembered, too, that his error of the ‘piratical\nexpedition’ is carried on for sixty lines—certainly a triumph of\ningenuity. It is useless to attempt a classification of the errors in\nthis version. In the words of Kemble:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Nothing but malevolence could cavil at the trivial errors which the\nvery best scholars are daily found to commit, but the case is widely\ndifferent when those errors are so numerous as totally to destroy the\nvalue of a work. I am therefore most reluctantly compelled to state\nthat not five lines of Thorkelin’s edition can be found in succession in\nwhich some gross fault, either in the transcription or translation, does\nnot betray the editor’s utter ignorance of the Anglo-Saxon language.’\n—Edition of 1835, Introd., p. xxix.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Reception of Thorkelin’s Edition.</h5>\n\n<p>The book was of value only in that it brought Beowulf to the\nattention of scholars.

        "introduction": "<h5>Grundtvig.</h5>\n\n<p>Nicolas Frederic Severin Grundtvig (1783–1872) was especially\nnoted as a student of Old Germanic literature. He began his career in\n1806 by his studies on the <i>Edda</i>. This was followed by a book on\nNorthern Mythology (1810), and by various creative works in verse and\nprose, the subjects of which were usually drawn from old Danish history.\nAn account of his labors on the <i>Beowulf</i> will be found in the\nfollowing section. His interest in Old English literature continued\nthrough his long life, and he was well and favorably known among the\nscholars of his day.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>\n\n<p>In <i>Beowulfs Beorh</i> (Copenhagen, 1861), Grundtvig tells the\nstory of his early translation of the poem. He had always had a\npassionate interest in Danish antiquities, and was much excited upon the\nappearance of Thorkelin’s text<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grundtvig2\" id=\"tag_grundtvig2\" href=\"#note_grundtvig2\">2</a>. At that time,\nhowever, he knew no Old English,\n\nand his friend Rask, the famous scholar in Germanic philology, being\nabsent from Denmark, he resolved to do what he could with the poem\nhimself. He began by committing the entire poem to memory. In this way\nhe detected many of the outlines which had been obscured by Thorkelin.\nThe results of this study he published in the <i>Copenhagen\nSketch-Book</i> (<i>Kjøbenhavns Skilderie</i>), 1815. When Thorkelin saw\nthe studies he was furious, and pronounced the discoveries mere\nfabrications.</p>\n\n<p>But Rask, upon his return, thought differently, and proposed to\nGrundtvig that they edit the poem together. They began the work, but\nwhen they reached line 925 the edition was interrupted by Rask’s journey\ninto Russia and Asia. With the help of Rask’s <i>Anglo-Saxon Grammar</i>\n(Stockholm, 1817), Grundtvig proceeded with his translation. By the\nmunificence of Bülow, who had also given assistance to Thorkelin,\nGrundtvig was relieved of the expense of publication.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem.</h5>\n\n<p>Grundtvig was the first to understand the story of <i>Beowulf</i>.\nWith no other materials than Thorkelin’s edition of the text and his own\nknowledge of Germanic mythology, he discovered the sea-burial of King\nScyld, the swimming-match, and the Finn episode. He identified Breca,\nHnæf, Hengest, King Hrethel, and other characters whose names Thorkelin\nhad filched from them.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Text Used.</h5>\n\n<p>Rask borrowed the original transcripts which Thorkelin had brought\nfrom the British Museum, and copied and corrected them. This was the\nbasis of Grundtvig’s translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>The principal difference is in the introduction; but of the nature\nand extent of changes in the second edition I can give no notion. All my\ninformation respecting the first volume is derived from transcripts of\ncertain parts of it sent me from the British Museum. These copies do not\nreveal any differences between the two translations.</p>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_grundtvig_aim\" id=\"trans_grundtvig_aim\">\nAim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translation.</a></h5>\n\n<p>We begin by quoting the author’s words:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘I have studied the poem as if I were going to translate it word for\nword . . . but I will not and have not translated it in\nthat way, and I will venture to maintain that my translation is a\nfaithful one, historically faithful, inasmuch as I have never wilfully\naltered or interpolated anything, and poetically faithful inasmuch as I\nhave tried with all my might vividly to express what I saw in the\npoem. . . . Whoever understands both languages and\npossesses a poetical sense will see what I mean, and whoever is\ndeficient in knowledge or sense, or both, may stick to his own view, if\nhe will only let me stick to mine, which may be weak enough, but is not\nso utterly devoid of style and poetry as little pettifoggers in the\nintellectual world maintain because they can see very well that my\nmethod is not theirs. “I have,” said Cicero, “translated\nDemosthenes, not as a grammarian but as an orator, and therefore have\nstriven not so much to convince as to persuade my readers of the truth\nof his words”: methinks I need no other defence as regards connoisseurs\nand just judges, and if I am much mistaken in this opinion, then my work\nis absolutely indefensible<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grundtvig3\" id=\"tag_grundtvig3\" href=\"#note_grundtvig3\">3</a>.’ —Pages xxxiv,\nxxxv.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the introduction to his text of 1861, Grundtvig speaks of his\ntheory of translation, saying that he gave, as it were, new clothes, new\nmoney, and new language to the poor old Seven Sleepers, so that they\ncould associate freely with moderns. He believed that it was necessary\nto put the poem into a form that would seem natural and\n\nattractive to the readers of the day. In so doing he departed from the\nletter of the law, and rewrote the poem according to his own ideas.</p>\n\n<p>In the second edition the author states that he hopes the poem will\nprove acceptable as a reading-book for schools. Its value as a text-book\nin patriotism is also alluded to.</p>",

        "criticism": "<p>The poem departs so far from the text of <i>Beowulf</i> that any\ndiscussion of its accuracy would be out of place. As has been shown by\nthe section on the nature of the translation, the author had no\nintention of being true to the letter of the text. Grundtvig’s\nscholarship has been discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>The translation may properly be called nothing more than a\nparaphrase. Whole sentences are introduced that have no connection with\nthe original text. Throughout the translation is evident the robust, but\nnot always agreeable, personality of the translator. In his preface<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grundtvig5\" id=\"tag_grundtvig5\" href=\"#note_grundtvig5\">5</a> Grundtvig remarked that he put nothing into his\npoem that was not historically and poetically true to the original. The\nstatement can only be regarded as an unfortunate exaggeration.\nGrundtvig’s style cannot be called even a faint reflection of the\n<i>Beowulf</i> style. He has popularized the story, and he has cheapened\nit. There is no warrant in the original for the coarse invective of the\nextract that has just been cited. In the Old English, Hunferth taunts\nBeowulf, but he never forgets that his rival is ‘doughty in battle’\n(l. 526). Beowulf is always worthy of his respect. In Grundtvig,\nthe taunting degenerates into a scurrilous tirade. Hunferth calls\nBeowulf a ‘mudscow’; Breca and Beowulf swim like two ‘dead herrings.’ In\nlike manner the character of Hunferth is cheapened. In <i>Beowulf</i> he\nis a jealous courtier, but he is always heroic. In Grundtvig he is\nmerely a contemptible braggart, ‘with his nose high in air,’ who will\nnot allow himself to be ‘thrown to the rubbish heap.’</p>\n\n<p>The same false manner is retained throughout the poem. In many places\nit reads well—it is often an excellent\n\nstory. But it can lay no claim to historic or poetic fidelity to the\n<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Reception of the Book.</h5>\n\n<p>The book fell dead from the press. Grundtvig himself tells us that it\nwas hardly read outside his own house<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grundtvig6\" id=\"tag_grundtvig6\" href=\"#note_grundtvig6\">6</a>.\nThirty years later he learned that the book had never reached the Royal\nLibrary at Stockholm. A copy made its way to the British Museum,\nbut it was the one which Grundtvig himself carried thither in 1829. This\nwas doubtless the copy that was read and criticized by Thorpe and\nWackerbarth.

        "introduction": "<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>\n\n<p>The volume had its origin in the Terminal Lectures which the author\ngave as Professor of Anglo-Saxon and\n\nPoetry at Oxford from 1809 to 1812<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_conybeare1\" id=\"tag_conybeare1\" href=\"#note_conybeare1\">1</a>.\nWe know from an autobiographical note printed in the Introduction<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_conybeare2\" id=\"tag_conybeare2\" href=\"#note_conybeare2\">2</a> that the <i>Beowulf</i> was finished in\nOctober, 1820. But the book did not appear until two years after the\nauthor’s death, and the material which it contains is of a slightly\nearlier date than the title-page would seem to indicate—e.g. the\nvolume really antedates the third edition of Turner’s History discussed\nabove<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_conybeare3\" id=\"tag_conybeare3\" href=\"#note_conybeare3\">3</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Conybeare, and the Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem.</h5>\n\n<p>Conybeare did not edit the entire poem, and apparently never had any\nintention of so doing. The selections which he translates are based on\nThorkelin’s text. He revises this text, however, in making his\ntranslations, and even incorporates a collation of Thorkelin’s text with\nthe MS. (pp. 137–55). This collation, though not complete or\naccurate, was serviceable, and kept Conybeare from falling into some of\nthe errors that the Icelander had made. He distinguished by an asterisk\nthe MS. readings which were of material importance in giving the sense\nof a passage, and, in fact, constructed for himself a text that was\npractically new.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The text has been throughout carefully collated with the original\nManuscript, and the translation of Thorkelin revised with all the\ndiligence of which the editor is capable.’ —Page 32.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Any attempt to restore the metre, and to correct the version\nthroughout, would have exceeded the bounds, and involved much discussion\nforeign to the purpose of the present work. This must be left to the\nlabours of the Saxon scholar. It is evident, however, that without a\nmore correct text than that of Thorkelin, those labours must be\nhopeless. The wish of supplying that deficiency, may perhaps\n\napologize for the occupying, by this Collation, so large a space of a\nwork strictly dedicated to other purposes.’ —Page 137, footnote.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How much Conybeare improved the text may be seen by comparing his\ntext and Latin translation with those of Thorkelin. The first six lines\nof the Prolog follow:—</p>\n\n<table class=\"verse\" summary=\"parallel poems\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"smallcaps\">Conybeare.</th>\n<th class=\"smallcaps\">Thorkelin.</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Hwæt we Gar-Dena</td>\n<td>Hwæt wegar Dena</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>In ȝear-dagum</td>\n<td>In geardagum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ðeod cyninga</td>\n<td>Þeod cyninga</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ðrym ȝefrunon,</td>\n<td>Þrym gefrunon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hu ða Æðelingas</td>\n<td>Hu ða æþelingas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ellen fremodon. —Page 82.</td>\n<td>Ellen fremodon. —Page 3.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"full\" colspan=\"2\">\n<p>The translations are even more interesting:—</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aliquid nos <i>de</i> Bellicorum Danorum</td>\n<td>Quomodo Danorum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>In diebus antiquis</td>\n<td>In principio</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Popularium regum</td>\n<td>Populus Regum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gloriâ accepimus,</td>\n<td>Gloriam auxerit,</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quomodo tunc principes</td>\n<td>Quomodo principes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Virtute valuerint.</td>\n<td>Virtute promoverit.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>It will be seen that in these lines Conybeare has at almost every\npoint the advantage over Thorkelin, and is indeed very nearly in accord\nwith modern texts and translations. But the poem yet awaited a complete\nunderstanding, for Conybeare could say: ‘The Introduction is occupied by\nthe praises of Scefing . . . and of his son and successor\nBeowulf. The embarkation of the former on a piratical expedition is then\ndetailed at some length. In this expedition (if I rightly understand the\ntext) himself and his companions were taken or lost at sea’\n(p. 35). And, in general, he misses the same points of the story as\nThorkelin, although he craftily refrains from translating the obscurer\npassages.</p>\n\n<p>Conybeare apparently knew nothing of the critical work of Grundtvig.\nThis is not surprising when we remember that <i>Kjøbenhavns\nSkilderie</i> was probably not known outside\n\nof Denmark<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_conybeare4\" id=\"tag_conybeare4\" href=\"#note_conybeare4\">4</a>. Moreover, it is to be remembered that\nConybeare’s extracts from the <i>Beowulf</i> are not really later than\nGrundtvig’s translation, since they were made in the same year, 1820<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_conybeare5\" id=\"tag_conybeare5\" href=\"#note_conybeare5\">5</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translations.</h5>\n\n<p>From the words quoted above with respect to the collation, it will be\nseen that Conybeare in no way regarded his book as a contribution to\nBeowulf scholarship. As professor at Oxford, he attempted a literary\npresentation of the most beautiful parts of the old poetry. His extracts\nare, in general, nothing more than free paraphrases. Wishing to\npopularize the <i>Beowulf</i>, he used as a medium of translation a\npeculiarly stilted kind of blank verse. He dressed the poem out in\nelegant phrases in order to hide the barrenness of the original.\nManifestly he feared the roughness, the remoteness of the poem in its\nnatural state. He feared to offend a nation of readers reveling in the\nmedievalism of Scott and Byron. A literal Latin translation was\ninserted to appease the scholar.</p>",

        "criticism": "<p>The English version is scarcely more than a paraphrase, as may easily\nbe seen by comparing it with the literal translation into Latin. But\neven as a paraphrase it is unsatisfactory. By way of general criticism\nit may be said that, while it attains a kind of dignity, it is not the\ndignity of <i>Beowulf</i>, for it is self-conscious. Like <i>Beowulf</i>\nit is elaborate, but it is the elaboration of art rather than of\nfeeling. Moreover, it is freighted with Miltonic phrase, and constantly\nsuggests the Miltonic movement. The trick of verse in line 3 is quite\ntoo exquisite for <i>Beowulf</i>. The whole piece has a straining after\npomp and majesty that is utterly foreign to the simple, often baldly\nsimple, ideas and phrases of the original. Nearly every adjective is\nsupplied by the translator: in Old English the ‘sword’ is ‘bloody,’ in\nConybeare the ‘gallant sword drops fast a gory dew’; the cave becomes a\nmansion; the ‘floor’ is ‘dust’—dust in an ocean\ncave!—‘heaven’s candle’ becomes ‘heaven’s glorious torch.’ The\npoem is tricked out almost beyond recognition. Beowulf assumes the\n‘grand manner,’ and paces ‘the Grendel’s hold’ like one of the strutting\nemperors of Dryden’s elaborate drama.</p>",

        "description": "First English Translation. Prose.",
        "introduction": "<h5>The 1833 Volume.</h5>\n\n<p>A sufficient account of this volume is given by Professor Earle, who\nsays of it:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The text was an improvement on Thorkelin, but still very\nfaulty;—to say nothing of inaccuracies from want of proper\noversight as the sheets were passing through the press. The Glossary,\nthough short, was a valuable acquisition . . . Of this\nedition only 100 copies were printed;—and it was a happy\nlimitation, as it left room for a new edition as early as 1835, in which\nthe text was edited with far greater care. All the rest remained as\nbefore, and the Preface was reprinted word for word.’ —<i>Deeds of\nBeowulf</i>, pp. xix, xx.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>The Text of 1835. Kemble’s Scholarship.</h5>\n\n<p>But whatever may be said of the text of 1833, there is nothing but\npraise for the edition of 1835. In this book\n\nthe poem first had the advantage of a modern scholarly treatment, and\nfor the first time the text of the MS. was correctly transcribed. It\nreceived its first punctuation. For the first time it was properly\ndivided into half-lines, with attention to alliteration. The text was\nfreely emended, but the suggested readings were placed in the footnotes,\nin order not to impair the value of the text as a reproduction of the\nMS. The necessity for this was made evident by Kemble\nhimself:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘But while he makes the necessary corrections, no man is justified in\nwithholding the original readings: for although the laws of a language,\nascertained by wide and careful examination of all the cognate tongues,\nof the hidden springs and ground-principles upon which they rest in\ncommon, are like the laws of the Medes and Persians and alter not, yet\nthe very errors of the old writer are valuable, and serve sometimes as\nguides and clues to the inner being and spiritual tendencies of the\nlanguage itself. The reader will moreover be spared that, to some\npeople, heart-burning necessity of taking his editor’s qualifications\ntoo much for granted, if side by side he is allowed to judge of the\ntraditional error, and the proposed correction. I have endeavoured\nto accomplish this end by printing the text, letter for letter, as I\nfound it.’ —Preface, pp. xxiv ff.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this wholesome respect for the tradition of the MS., it is not\nstrange that Kemble’s carefully chosen emendations should stand to-day\nas of high critical value, and that many of them are retained in modern\neditions of the text<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble1\" id=\"tag_kemble1\" href=\"#note_kemble1\">1</a>. When we compare Kemble’s\nbook with Thorkelin’s, the advance is seen to be little less than\nastonishing. Thorkelin’s emendations were worse than useless.</p>\n\n<p>Kemble had a full acquaintance with the new science of comparative\nphilology which was developing in Germany under Jakob Grimm. He had\ncorresponded, and later studied, with Grimm, and, according to William\nHunt, was the ‘recognised exponent’ of his investigations<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble2\" id=\"tag_kemble2\" href=\"#note_kemble2\">2</a>. It is to\n\nGrimm that Kemble dedicates his volumes, and to him that he repeatedly\nacknowledges his indebtedness. Thus Kemble brought to the study of the\npoem not only a knowledge of the Old English poetry and prose, but\nacquaintance with Old Norse, Gothic, Old High German, and Old Saxon. It\nmay sufficiently illustrate his scholarly method to instance examples of\nhis treatment of the unique words in <i>Beowulf</i>. Take, e.g., the\nword <i>hose</i> in line 924. This word does not appear elsewhere in Old\nEnglish; it does not appear in Lye’s <i>Dictionary</i>, the only\ndictionary that was at Kemble’s disposal. Upon this word Kemble brought\nto bear his knowledge of the Germanic tongues, and by citing Goth.\n<i>hansa</i>, OHG. <i>hansa</i>, &amp;c., derived the meaning\n<i>turma</i>—a process in which he is supported by a modern\nauthority like Kluge. The study of compounds also first began with\nKemble. He collected and compared the compounds in <i>heaðo.</i>. Thus\nhe laid the foundation of all modern studies on the Old English\ncompound.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Further Critical Material Afforded by the Volume of 1837.</h5>\n\n<p>In the 1835 volume twenty-three words were illustrated in the above\nway. But it remained for the 1837 volume to present a complete glossary\nof the poem, containing also important poetic words not in\n<i>Beowulf</i>. By reason of its completeness and comparative work, it\nremained the standard commentary on the Old English poetic vocabulary\nuntil the appearance of Grein’s <i>Sprachschatz</i><a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble3\" id=\"tag_kemble3\" href=\"#note_kemble3\">3</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of Kemble’s Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Like his edition of the text, Kemble’s translation is quite\nindependent of any preceding book; like his edition of the text, its aim\nwas faithfulness to the original. He adheres scrupulously to the text,\nsave where the original\n\nis unintelligible. The translation was designed to be used together with\nthe glossary as a part of the apparatus for interpreting the poem. He\ntherefore made it strictly literal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The translation is a literal one; I was bound to give, word for word,\nthe original in all its roughness: I might have made it smoother,\nbut I purposely avoided doing so, because had the Saxon poet thought as\nwe think, and expressed his thoughts as we express our thoughts,\nI might have spared myself the trouble of editing or translating\nhis poem. A few transpositions of words, &amp;c. caused principally\nby the want of inflections in New English (since we have now little more\nthan their position by which to express the relations of words to one\nanother) are all that I have allowed myself, and where I have inserted\nwords I have generally printed them in italics.’ —\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"page\">\nPostscript to the Preface, p. 1.</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallroman\">VIII.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\nHunferth the son of Eglaf spake, <i>he</i> that sat at the feet of the\nLord of the Scyldings; he bound up<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble4\" id=\"tag_kemble4\" href=\"#note_kemble4\">4</a> a quarrelsome\nspeech: to him was the journey of Beowulf, the proud sea-farer,\na great disgust; because he granted not that any other man should\never have beneath the skies, more reputation with the world than he\nhimself: ‘Art thou the Beowulf that didst contend with Brecca on the\nwide sea, in a swimming match, where ye for pride explored the fords,\nand out of vain glory ventured your lives upon the deep water? nor might\nany man, friend or foe, blame<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble5\" id=\"tag_kemble5\" href=\"#note_kemble5\">5</a> your sorrowful expedition:\nthere ye rowed upon the sea, there ye two covered the ocean-stream with\nyour arms, measured the sea-streets, whirled them with your hands,\nglided over the ocean; with the waves of the deep<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble6\" id=\"tag_kemble6\" href=\"#note_kemble6\">6</a> the fury\nof winter boiled; ye two on the realms of water laboured for a week: he\novercame thee in swimming, he had more strength: then at the morning\ntide the deep sea bore him up on Hēathoræmes, whence he sought his own\npaternal land, dear to his people, the land of the Brondings, where he\nowned\n\na nation, a town, and rings. All his promise to thee, the son\nof Beanstan truly performed.’\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>Kemble’s scholarship enabled him to get a full understanding of the\npoem, and thus to make the first really adequate translation of\n<i>Beowulf</i>. He was the first to recognize the significance of\nkenning, metaphor, and compound. Thus his work is to be commended\nchiefly because of its faithfulness. All preceding studies had been\nwofully inaccurate<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble7\" id=\"tag_kemble7\" href=\"#note_kemble7\">7</a>. Kemble’s editions became at\nonce the authoritative commentary on the text, and held this position\nuntil the appearance of Grein’s <i>Bibliothek</i> (1857). In this latter\nbook, Kemble’s text was the principal authority used in correcting the\nwork of Thorpe<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_kemble8\" id=\"tag_kemble8\" href=\"#note_kemble8\">8</a>.

        "introduction": "<h5>Ettmüller.</h5>\n\n<p>Ernst Moritz Ludwig Ettmüller (1802–77), at the time of the\npublication of this book, was professor of the German\n\nlanguage and literature in the Gymnasium at Zürich. He had already\nappeared as a translator with a work entitled <i>Lieder der Edda von den\nNibelungen</i>. Later he edited selections from the <i>Beowulf</i> in\nhis <i>Engla and Seaxna Scôpas and Bôceras</i> (1850). This text\nincorporated many new readings. Ettmüller was the first to question the\nunity of the <i>Beowulf</i>, and sketched a theory of interpolations\nwhich has since been developed by Müllenhoff. The first announcement of\nthese views is found in the introduction to this translation.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Theory of Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Ettmüller gives full expression to his theories and aims:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Vor Allem habe ich so wörtlich als möglich übersetzt, da Treue das\nerste Erforderniss einer guten Übersetzung ist. Dann aber war mein\nAugenmerk vorzüglich auf Wohlklang und Verständlichkeit gerichtet.\nLetztere werden bei Übersetzungen dieser Art nur zu oft vernachlässigt,\nda manche der Ansicht sind, ihre Arbeit sei um so besser, je treuer sie\ndie äussere Form des Originals in allen Einzelheiten wiedergebe. Aber\ndieweil diese so mühsam an der Schale knacken, entschlüpft ihnen nicht\nselten der Kern. Mein Bestreben war demnach keineswegs, z.B. jeden Vers\nängstlich dem Originale nachzubilden, so dass die genaueste\nÜbereinstimmung zwischen der Silbenzahl und den Hebungen oder gar dem\nKlange der Verse Statt fände. Das wäre ohnehin, ohne der deutschen\nSprache die schreiendste Gewalt anzuthun, unmöglich gewesen. Ich habe\nvielmehr darnach mit Sorgfalt gestrebt, die Versbildung des\nangelsächsischen Gedichtes mir in allen ihren Erscheinungen klar zu\nmachen, und dann frei nach dem <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘gewonnen’\">gewonnenen</ins> Schema gearbeitet. Daher kann ich\nversichern, dass man für jeden Vers meiner Übersetzung gewiss ein\nangelsächsisches Vorbild findet, wenn auch nicht grade jedesmal die\nVerse einander decken. Dass dabei übrigens der höheren Rhythmik, d.h.\ndem ästhetisch richtigen Verhältnisse des Ausdruckes zu dem\nAusgedrückten oder, mit Klopstock zu reden, des Zeitausdruckes oder\nTonverhaltes (der Bewegung) zu dem Gedanken, überall die grösste\nSorgfalt zugewendet ward, das braucht, dünkt mich, keiner besondern\nVersicherung; dies aber kann erreicht werden auch ohne knechtische\nNachbildung des Originals.’ —Page 59.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h5>Text, and Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is founded on Kemble’s text of 1835<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_ettmuller1\" id=\"tag_ettmuller1\" href=\"#note_ettmuller1\">1</a>, to which the introduction and notes are also\nindebted.</p>\n\n<p>Like Kemble, Ettmüller was a close student of the works of Jakob\nGrimm, and his interpretation of obscure lines (especially passages\nrelating to Germanic antiquities) is largely due to the study of such\nworks as the <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i> (1833), the <i>Deutsche\nRechtsalterthümer</i> (1828), and the <i>Deutsche Sagen</i>\n(1816–8).

        "criticism": "<p>In his translation Ettmüller followed in the steps of Kemble<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_ettmuller2\" id=\"tag_ettmuller2\" href=\"#note_ettmuller2\">2</a>, but he was not slavishly dependent upon him.\nAt times he disagrees with the English scholar (cp. e.g., ll. 468, 522,\n1331), and offers a translation of the passage omitted by him,\n3069–74. In general, the translation is strictly literal, and\nfollows the original almost line for line.</p>\n\n<p>It was probably well for Ettmüller that he made his translation thus\nliteral. In the history of a foreign-language study there is a period\nwhen it is best that a translation should be strictly literal, for such\na work is bound to be called into service as a part of the critical\napparatus for the interpretation of the tongue. If the early translation\nis not thus literal, it is sure to be superseded later by the more\nfaithful rendering, as Schaldemose’s superseded Grundtvig’s in Denmark<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_ettmuller3\" id=\"tag_ettmuller3\" href=\"#note_ettmuller3\">3</a>. It is not until criticism and scholarship have\ndone their strictly interpretative work that a translation is safe in\nattempting to render the spirit rather than the letter of the original.\nThe reason for this is evident: no real appreciation of the spirit is\npossible until scholarship has provided the means for\ndiscovering it.</p>\n\n<p>By the publication of this volume, therefore, Ettmüller did for\nGerman scholarship what Kemble had done for English and Schaldemose was\nto do for Danish scholarship. Yet he might with propriety have made his\nwork more simple. His translation is disfigured by numerous strange\nword-combinations which he often transcribed literally from the\noriginal, e.g. <i>beadu-runen</i> in the third line of the extract. It\nis safe to say that none but a scholar in Old English would be able to\nunderstand this word—if, indeed, we may call it a word. The text\nis full of such forms. The author\n\nis obliged to append notes explaining his own translation! He apparently\nforgets that it is his business as translator to render the difficult\nwords as well as the simple ones. In Ettmüller’s case it was especially\nunfortunate, because it gave others an opportunity to come forward later\nwith simpler, and hence more useful, translations.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Reception of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The book had no extraordinary success. A reprint was never\ncalled for, and was perhaps hardly to be expected, considering the\nexistence of Kemble’s volumes. Moreover, the translation was not\naccompanied by an edition of the text.

        "introduction": "<h5>Nature of the Volume, and Indebtedness to Previous Scholars.</h5>\n\n<p>In this book the Old English text and the Danish translation were\nprinted in parallel columns. The text, which was taken literally from\nKemble<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_schaldemose1\" id=\"tag_schaldemose1\" href=\"#note_schaldemose1\">1</a>, need not detain us here. No mention\nis made of the work of Leo<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_schaldemose2\" id=\"tag_schaldemose2\" href=\"#note_schaldemose2\">2</a>, Ettmüller<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_schaldemose3\" id=\"tag_schaldemose3\" href=\"#note_schaldemose3\">3</a>, or of the 1837 volume of Kemble, although\n\nthe influence of the latter is evident throughout the book, as will be\nshown below. The notes are drawn largely from the works of preceding\nscholars, and in these the author makes an occasional acknowledgement of\nindebtedness.</p>\n\n<p>The translation is literal. Grundtvig’s translation<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_schaldemose4\" id=\"tag_schaldemose4\" href=\"#note_schaldemose4\">4</a> had been so paraphrastic as often to obscure\nthe sense, and always the spirit, of the original. Schaldemose had the\nadvantage of presenting the most modern text side by side with the\ntranslation. Thus the book became a valuable <i>apparatus criticus</i>\nfor the Danish student.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Schaldemose.</h5>\n\n<p>The life of Frederik Schaldemose (1782–1853) was by no means\nthe quiet, retired life of the student. He had, it is true, been\nprofessor at the school of Nykjøbing from 1816 to 1825, and later\ndevoted himself to literary work; but a large part of his life had been\nspent in military service, in which he had had many exciting adventures\nby land and sea. After leaving his professorship he again entered\nmilitary service. Later, he devoted his time alternately to literary and\ncommercial work.</p>\n\n<p>His interest in <i>Beowulf</i> seems to have been, like that of\nThorkelin<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_schaldemose5\" id=\"tag_schaldemose5\" href=\"#note_schaldemose5\">5</a>, primarily the\ninterest of the Danish antiquary. In 1846 he had published a collection\nof Heroic Danish Songs, ancient and modern. It was doubtless a desire to\nadd to this collection that led him to undertake an edition of the\n<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>\n\n<p>It was hardly to be expected that a man whose life had been so\nunsettled could materially advance the interpretation of Old English\npoetry.</p>",

Mr. Kemble’s second Volume had not then appeared, and I proceeded\nbut slowly, on account of the Difficulty of the Work, and the utter\nInadequacy of any then existing Dictionary. I still however wrought\nmy Way onward, under the Notion that even if I should not think my Book,\nwhen finished, fit for Publication, yet that the MS. would form an\namusing Tale for my little Nephews and Nieces, and so I went through\nabout a Quarter of the Poem when Illness put an entire stop to my\nProgress. Afterwards, though the Appearance of Mr. Kemble’s additional\nVolume, containing the Prose\n\nVersion, Glossary, &amp;c. had rendered the remainder of my Task\ncomparatively easy, other Matters required my Attention, and the MS. lay\nuntouched until 1842, between which Time and the present it has been\nfrom Time to Time added to and at length completed, and the whole\ncarefully revised, much being cancelled and retranslated.’\n—Introduction, p. viii.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Indebtedness to preceding Scholars.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘In my Version I have scrupulously adhered to the text of Mr. Kemble,\nadopting in almost every Instance his Emendations. . . .\nMy thanks are due to Mr. Kemble . . . to the Rev. Dr.\nBosworth . . . who have . . . kindly\nanswered my Inquiries relative to various Matters connected with the\npoem.’ —Pages viii, xiv.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Style and Diction.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘I have throughout endeavoured to render the Sense and the Words of my\nAuthor as closely as the English Language and the Restraints of Metre\nwould allow, and for this Purpose I have not shrunken either from\nsacrificing Elegance to Faithfulness (for no Translator is at liberty to\nmisrepresent his Author and make an old Saxon Bard speak the Language of\na modern Petit Maître) or from uniting English Words to express\nimportant Anglo-Saxon compounds. . . . Some may ask why I\nhave not preserved the Anglo-Saxon alliterative Metre. My Reason is that\nI do not think the Taste of the English People would at present bear it.\nI wish to get my book read, that my Countrymen may become generally\nacquainted with the Epic of our Ancestors wherewith they have been\ngenerally unacquainted, and for this purpose it was necessary to adopt a\nMetre suited to the Language; whereas the alliterative Metre, heavy even\nin German, a Language much more fitted for it than ours, would in\nEnglish be so heavy that few would be found to labour through a Poem of\neven half the Length of the Beówulf’s lay when presented in so\nunattractive a Garb.’ —Pages ix, x.\n</blockquote>",

        "criticism": "<p>Wackerbarth’s translation is not to be considered as a rival of\nKemble’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_wackerbarth1\" id=\"tag_wackerbarth1\" href=\"#note_wackerbarth1\">1</a>—the author\ndid not wish it to be\n\nso considered. Kemble addressed the world of scholars; Wackerbarth the\nworld of readers. Wackerbarth rather resembles Conybeare<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_wackerbarth2\" id=\"tag_wackerbarth2\" href=\"#note_wackerbarth2\">2</a> in trying to reproduce the <i>spirit</i> of\nthe poem, and make his book appeal to a popular audience. Wackerbarth\nhad the advantage of basing his translation on the accurate and\nscholarly version of Kemble; yet Conybeare and Wackerbarth were equally\nunsuccessful in catching the spirit of the original. The reason for\ntheir failure is primarily in the media which they chose. It would seem\nthat if there were a measure less suited to the Beowulf style than the\nMiltonic blank verse used by Conybeare, it would be the ballad measures\nused by Wackerbarth. The movement of the ballad is easy, rapid, and\ngarrulous. Now, if there are three qualities of which the <i>Beowulf</i>\nis not possessed, they are ease, rapidity, and garrulity. Not only does\nthe poet avoid superfluous words—the ballad never does—but\nhe frequently does not use words enough. His meaning is thus often vague\nand nebulous, or harsh and knotted. Nor can the poem properly be called\nrapid. It is often hurried, and more often insufficient in detail, but\nit never has sustained rapidity. The kenning alone is hostile to\nrapidity. The poet lingers lovingly over his thought as if loath to\nleave it; he repeats, amplifies. The description of Grendel’s approach\nto Heorot is given three times within twenty lines.</p>\n\n<p>Now these features which have just been described Wackerbarth’s\nballad lines are eminently unfitted to transmit. But there is still\nanother reason for shunning them. They are almost continuously\nsuggestive of Scott. Of all men else the translator of <i>Beowulf</i>\nshould avoid Scott. Scott’s medievalism is hundreds of years and miles\naway from the medievalism of <i>Beowulf</i>. His is the self-conscious,\ndramatic, gorgeous age of\n\nchivalry, of knight and lady, of pomp and pride. <i>Beowulf</i> is\nsimple to bareness.</p>\n\n<p>It is in such strong picturesque passages as the swimming-match that\nWackerbarth’s style is worst. There is a plethora of adjectives,\nscarcely one of which is found in the original; but they are of no\navail—they are too commonplace to render the strength and raciness\nof the original words. There is too much ballad padding—‘then he\ncry’d,’ ‘at last,’ ‘well and faithfully,’ ‘onslaught dire, and deadly\nfight.’ Hunferth prattles.

        "introduction": "<h5>Author’s Prefatory Remarks.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Twenty-four years have passed since, while residing in Denmark,\nI first entertained the design of one day producing an edition of\nBeowulf; and it was in prosecution of that design that, immediately on\nmy arrival in England in 1830, I carefully collated the text of\nThorkelin’s edition with the Cottonian manuscript. Fortunately, no\ndoubt, for the work, a series of cares, together with other\nliterary engagements, intervened and arrested my progress. I had,\nin fact, abandoned every thought of ever resuming the task: it was\ntherefore with no slight pleasure that I hailed the appearance of Mr.\nKemble’s first edition of the text of Beowulf in\n1833. . . .\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Copies of Mr. Kemble’s editions having for some time past been of rare\noccurrence, I resolved on resuming my suspended labour, and, as far\nas I was able, supplying a want felt by many an Anglo-Saxon student both\nat home and abroad. . . .\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘My first impulse was to print the text of the poem as it appears in the\nmanuscript, with a literal translation in parallel columns, placing all\nconjectural emendations at the foot of each page; but, on comparing the\ntext with the version in this juxta-position, so numerous and so\nenormous and puerile did the blunders of the copyist appear, and,\nconsequently, so great the discrepance between the text and the\ntranslation, that I found myself compelled to admit into the text the\ngreater number of the conjectural emendations, consigning to the foot of\nthe page the corresponding readings of the manuscript. In every case\nwhich I thought might by others be considered questionable, I have\nfollowed the more usual course, of retaining in the text the reading of\nthe manuscript, and placing the proposed correction at\nfoot. . . .\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Very shortly after I had collated it, the manuscript suffered still\nfurther detriment.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘In forming this edition I resolved to proceed independently of the\nversion or views of every preceding editor.’ —Pages vii, viii,\nxii, xiii.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_thorpe_text\" id=\"trans_thorpe_text\">\nCriticism of Thorpe’s Text.</a></h5>\n\n<p>Considering the amount of time that had elapsed between this and the\nedition of Kemble<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorpe1\" id=\"tag_thorpe1\" href=\"#note_thorpe1\">1</a>, Thorpe can hardly be said to\nhave made a satisfactory advance. In some respects his edition is\nactually inferior to Kemble’s. It is probable,\n\nfor example, that the collation of which the author speaks in his\nintroduction was the one which he had made twenty years before, and\nthat, in taking up his work a second time, he did not trouble himself to\nrevise it. At any rate, the MS. did not receive from Thorpe that\nrespectful attention that it had had from Kemble. Thorpe was more clever\nthan the former scholar in deciphering faded lines of the MS., but he\nwas not always careful to indicate those letters which he actually found\nthere, and those he himself supplied from conjecture. Yet these readings\nwere often of sufficient importance to affect an entire passage, and\nlater scholarship has in many cases deciphered readings whose sense is\nentirely different from Thorpe’s. Thus his edition presents striking\ndivergences from later texts, while no explanation of them is offered in\nthe footnotes. Not only does he frequently incorporate his own readings\nin the text without noting the MS. forms, but he even makes mistakes in\nthe MS. forms which he does note. A collation of Thorpe’s text with\nthe MS. has revealed a carelessness which was all the more reprehensible\nin that it came from a scholar who was thought to be well-nigh\ninfallible. A few examples of this carelessness are\ngiven:—</p>\n\n<table class=\"lines\" summary=\"details of translations\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td class=\"number\">Line 319 (158)<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thorpe2\" id=\"tag_thorpe2\" href=\"#note_thorpe2\">2</a>,</td>\n<td><p><i>banan</i> (misreads MS. in footnote).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">487 (241),</td>\n<td><p><i>Ic</i> (word emended from <i>le</i> without noting MS.\nform).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">1160 (578),</td>\n<td><p><i>hwæþere</i> (emends without noting the MS. form).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">1207 (601),</td>\n<td><i>ac him</i> (omits a word).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">4408 (2201),</td>\n<td><p><i>hilde hlemmum</i> (MS. misread in a footnote.

Thorpe is seen to have the advantage in deciphering\ncertain parts of the text, see e.g. lines 9, 11, 17. On the other hand,\nKemble is far more conscientious. Thus at line 13 Thorpe reads <i>ne</i>\nas if it were found in the MS. It is not there, and Kemble is right in\ninclosing the letters in parentheses. The same\n\nthing is true of <i>Fǽr</i> in line 19, and Gren<i>dl</i>es in line 14.\nThorpe’s emendations in lines 3 and 5 are an advance on Kemble, and are\nstill retained in the text. But Thorpe might have followed Kemble’s\npunctuation in 18 and 19 to his advantage.</p>",

        "criticism": "<p>This being a strictly literal translation, the reader is referred to\nthe sections on the text for a valuation and criticism.

I am unable to agree with them. Probably any short-line\ntranslation would <i>ipso facto</i> assume a choppiness not dissimilar\nto the Old English, and probably plenty of lines could be discovered\nwhich correspond well enough to the ‘five types,’ but the agreement\nseems purely fortuitous.

        "introduction": "<h5>Grein’s Preparation for Scholarly Work.</h5>\n\n<p>Christian Wilhelm Michael Grein<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grein1\" id=\"tag_grein1\" href=\"#note_grein1\">1</a> (1825–77) was\neminently well fitted for the editing and translating of Old English\npoetry. He possessed a natural aptitude for the study of Germanic\nPhilology, and had the advantage of studying with an excellent\nprofessor, Franz Eduard Christoph Dietrich (1810–83), in the\nUniversity at Marburg. As early as 1854 he began his labors as a\ntranslator of Old English poetry with a version of the <i>Phoenix</i>,\n‘Der Vogel Phoenix: ein angelsächsisches Gedicht, stabreimend\nübersetzt,’\n\nRinteln, 1854. In the same year he printed a translation of the\n<i>Heliand</i>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1855 he assumed the position of Praktikant at the Kassel\nLandesbibliothek. Here he was able to devote a large part of his\nattention to the study of Old English, acquiring a familiarity with the\npoetry of that tongue which it has seldom been the fortune of a scholar\nto surpass. He formed the design of editing and translating the entire\nbody of Old English poetry and appending to it a complete glossary which\nshould not only give the meanings of the words, but instance every\noccurrence of the word. This design he carried out between the years\n1857 and 1864.</p>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_grein_texts\" id=\"trans_grein_texts\">\nGrein’s Texts.</a></h5>\n\n<p>The text of <i>Beowulf</i> is found in Grein’s <i>Bibliothek der\nangelsächsichen Poesie</i>, Erster Band, Göttingen, 1857, where it\noccupies pp. 255–341. A second edition, several times\nre-edited, is <i>Beovulf, nebst den Fragmenten Finnsburg und\nWaldere</i>, Kassel und Göttingen, 1867.</p>\n\n<p>Grein never saw the MS. of the poem<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grein2\" id=\"tag_grein2\" href=\"#note_grein2\">2</a>. He based his\ntext on a collation of all the preceding editions. This was unfortunate,\nbecause, had Grein seen the MS., he would doubtless have hastened to\nmake a correct transcription of it. As it was, his edition necessarily\nshares some of the faults of its predecessors, since the text had never\nyet been accurately transcribed. A simple illustration of this\ndefect may be seen by examining line 2218 of the text, where Grein\nreads,</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\n<i>be fire, fyrena hyrde</i>,</p>\n\n<p>following Thorpe<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_grein3\" id=\"tag_grein3\" href=\"#note_grein3\">3</a>. As has been pointed out, this\nis an impossible reading, and one for which there is no justification in\nthe MS. Thorpe, however, had presented it as the MS. reading, and Grein\ncould not but copy it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Like Kemble, Grein had a supreme respect for the readings of the MS.,\nand he announced his intention of following this reading wherever\npossible:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Bei der Behandlung des Textes galt als erste Pflicht, handschriftliche\nLesarten, wo es nur immer möglich war, zu retten und namentlich auch\nmanche angezweifelte, den Lexicis fremde Wörter als wolbegründet\nnachzuweisen: nur da, wo Verderbniss auf der Hand liegt, habe ich mir\nmit der grössten Vorsicht Aenderungen erlaubt oder bereits von Andern\nvorgeschlagene Aenderungen aufgenommen, wobei ich mich möglichst eng an\ndas handschriftlich gebotene anzuschliessen suchte.’ —Vorwort, iv.\n(<i>Bibl.</i>).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was wise. Since the days of Kemble, emendation had become\nunnecessarily frequent. We have seen in what a light-hearted way Thorpe\nspoke of the ‘blunders of the scribes,’ and how careless he was in the\npreparation of his text. The dialect had not yet received proper\nattention, and the copyists were blamed for errors that they never\nmade.</p>\n\n<p>Grein was extremely clever in filling the lacunae of the MS., and his\nconjectural emendations are frequently retained by later editors.</p>\n\n<p>Still another improvement which he introduced was the full\npunctuation of the text; this was superior to any that had preceded it.\nIn previous editions defective punctuation had obscured the sense of the\nlines; here it was made a factor in their interpretation.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Theory of Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Grein’s theory of translation is sufficiently expressed in the\nVorrede to the <i>Dichtungen</i>:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Die Sammlung von metrischen Uebersetzungen angelsächsischer Dichtungen,\nderen erster Band hiermit der Oeffentlichkeit übergeben wird, soll einen\ndoppelten Zweck erfüllen. Einerseits betrachte ich dieselben als eine\nwesentliche Ergänzung, gleichsam als fortlaufenden Commentar zu meiner\ngleichzeitig in demselben Verlag erscheinenden Textausgabe der\nangelsächsischen Dichter, indem sie meine Interpretation\n\nder Originaltexte, worin ich oft von meinen Vorgängern abweiche, einfach\nvor Augen legen. Andrerseits aber bezweckte ich dadurch die\nBekanntschaft mit den in vieler Beziehung so herrlichen dichterischen\nErzeugnissen des uns engverwandten englischen Volkes aus der Zeit vor\ndem gewaltsamen Eindringen des romanischen Elements durch die\nnormannische Eroberung auch in weiteren Kreisen anzubahnen, was sie\nsowol nach ihrem Inhalte als auch nach der poetischen Behandlung des\nStoffes gewiss in hohem Grade verdienen. Daher war ich eifrigst bemüht,\ndie Uebersetzung dem Original in möglichster Treue nach Inhalt, Ausdruck\nund Form eng anzuschliessen: namentlich suchte ich, soweit es immer bei\ndem heutigen Stande unserer Sprache thunlich war, auch den Rhythmus des\nOriginals nachzubilden, wobei es vor allem auf die Beibehaltung der\neigentümlichen Stellung der Stabreime ankam, ein Punkt, der bei der\nUebertragung alter Alliterationspoesien nur zu oft vernachlässigt wird.’\n—Vorrede, iii.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Differences between the two Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>The second edition of the translation (see supra, <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"error for ‘p. 55’\"><a href=\"#trans_grein\">p. 65</a></ins>) was edited from Grein’s\n‘Handexemplar’ of the <i>Dichtungen</i> after his death by Professor\nWülker, who has also re-edited the text of the <i>Bibliothek</i>. The\ndifferences are seldom more than verbal, and are largely in the early\nparts of the poem. The second edition is, of course, superior.</p>",

        "description": "Third German Translation. Imitative Measures.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Simrock.</h5>\n\n<p>Dr. Karl Simrock (1802–1876) brought to the translation of\n<i>Beowulf</i> the thorough knowledge of a scholar,\n\nthe fine feeling and technique of a poet, and an enviable reputation as\na translator of Old German poetry. At the time when he made his\ntranslation of <i>Beowulf</i>, he was Professor of Old German Literature\nat Bonn, whither he had been called because of his contributions to the\nstudy of Old German mythology. His title to remembrance rests, however,\non his metrical rendering of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, a work\nwhich, in 1892, had passed into its fifty-second edition. As an original\npoet, Simrock is remembered for his <i>Wieland der Schmied</i> (1835),\nand <i>Gedichte</i> (1844).</p>\n\n\n<h5>Object of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Simrock wished to do for <i>Beowulf</i> what he had done for the\n<i>Nibelungenlied</i>, <i>Walther von der Vogelweide</i>, and <i>Der\narme Heinrich</i>. He objected to the too literal work of Ettmüller<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_simrock1\" id=\"tag_simrock1\" href=\"#note_simrock1\">1</a> and Grein<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_simrock2\" id=\"tag_simrock2\" href=\"#note_simrock2\">2</a>, hoping in his own\nwork to make the poem readable and to dispense with a ‘note for every\nthird word’:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Geist und Stimmung einer fernen Heldenzeit anklingen zu lassen, und\ndoch dem Ausdruck die frische Farbe des Lebens zu verleihen.’\n—Vorrede, iii.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this ambition he was justified by his success as a translator of\nOld German poetry.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The diction of the version is, on the whole, characterized by\nsimplicity and ease. Yet the author, like many another translator of Old\nEnglish, tries to give his style an archaic tinge by preserving the\ncompound forms characteristic of that language, such as Lustholz,\nAelgelage, Kampfrunen, a fault that Ettmüller had carried to\nexcess. These forms he sometimes used to the exclusion of simpler, or\neven\n\nmore literal, words. The nature of the German language, however, keeps\nthese from being as repulsive as they are in English, but they are\nsufficiently strange to mystify and annoy the reader.</p>\n\n<p>The feature of his translation for which Simrock was most concerned\nwas the measure:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Vor Allem aber den Wohllaut, der echter Poesie unzertrennlich verbunden\nist, das schien mir die erste Bedingung, damit der\nLeser . . . den Sinn ahne und von der Schönheit des <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘Gedichtes’\">Gedichts</ins>\nergriffen von Blatt zu Blatt getragen werde. Nur so glaubte ich eine\ntausendjährige Kluft überbrücken und dieser mit Angeln und Sachsen\nausgewanderten Dichtung neues Heimatsrecht bei uns erwerben zu können.’\n—Vorrede, iii, iv.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also preserved alliteration, believing that a fondness for that\npoetic adornment may be easily acquired, and that it is by no means\ninconsistent with the genius of modern tongues.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Relation of Translation and other Parts of the Book.</h5>\n\n<p>The notes to the translation contain discussions of the episodes and\nof the mythological personages of the poem. There is a discussion of the\npoetic worth of <i>Beowulf</i>, and an argument for the German origin of\nthe poem. But the translation is the <i>raison d’être</i> of the volume,\nand other parts are strictly subordinated to it. The Finnsburg fragment\nis inserted at the end of section 16. As the author does not wish\nto disturb the order of <i>Beowulf</i>, he is obliged to place the poem\nat the end of the Finnsburg episode (in <i>Beowulf</i>), a very\nill-chosen position, where it can only confuse the general reader more\nthan the obscure lines to which it is related. This practice of\ninserting the Finnsburg fragment, lately revived by Hoffmann<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_simrock3\" id=\"tag_simrock3\" href=\"#note_simrock3\">3</a>, has been generally repudiated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Text, and Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars.</h5>\n\n<p>The text followed is Grein’s (1857)<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_simrock4\" id=\"tag_simrock4\" href=\"#note_simrock4\">4</a>. The\ntranslator acknowledges his indebtedness to the versions of Ettmüller\nand Grein.</p>",

Yet, in spite of this, the\nbook is not well known among German translations, and has never passed\ninto a second edition. This is surprising when we consider the success\nof Simrock’s previous translations. The partial failure is accounted for\nby two facts: (1) Simrock’s reputation as a scholar was not equal\nto that of Grein or Heyne, nor had he the advantage of editing the text;\n(2) the measure which the translation employed has never been\npopular among readers. No German translation in imitative measures, with\nthe single exception of Grein’s (which has made its appeal as a\nscholarly work and not as a piece of literature), has ever passed into a\nsecond edition; while versions couched in iambic lines or Nibelungen\nmeters have been reprinted.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Heyne.</h5>\n\n<p>The name of Moritz Heyne is one of the most illustrious in the\nhistory of Beowulf scholarship. The Heyne editions of the text<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne1\" id=\"tag_heyne1\" href=\"#note_heyne1\">1</a>\nhave been standard for nearly forty years,\n\nwhile the translation has been recently reprinted (1898). Beside his\nwork on the <i>Beowulf</i>, this scholar was to become prominent as\neditor of the <i>Heliand</i> and of <i>Ulfilas</i>, and as one of the\nstaff appointed to complete Grimm’s Dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>At the time when he printed his edition of the <i>Beowulf,</i> Heyne\nwas a student at Halle, and but twenty-six years of age (born 1837)<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne2\" id=\"tag_heyne2\" href=\"#note_heyne2\">2</a>. In his work he had some assistance from Professor\nLeo<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne3\" id=\"tag_heyne3\" href=\"#note_heyne3\">3</a> of Halle.</p>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_heyne_relation\" id=\"trans_heyne_relation\">\nRelation of Text and Translation.</a></h5>\n\n<p>The translation was founded on the text of 1863. At the time it was\nby far the best edition that had yet appeared. It was furnished with an\nexcellent glossary. The text had the advantage of the valuable work done\nby Grundtvig<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne4\" id=\"tag_heyne4\" href=\"#note_heyne4\">4</a> in collating the two transcripts made by\nThorkelin<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne5\" id=\"tag_heyne5\" href=\"#note_heyne5\">5</a>. It thus came a stage nearer the MS. readings than\nany other existing edition, while it avoided the unnecessary conjectures\nof the Danish editor.</p>\n\n<p>Heyne’s text having been five times re-edited, the first edition of\nthe translation often fails to conform to readings which have been\nintroduced into the text in later editions; but the free nature of the\ntranslation makes this of no great importance.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions of the\nTranslation.</h5>\n\n<p>The differences between the two editions are not of much importance.\nThe translation is in general, though not always, brought up to the late\neditions of the text,\n\nand some changes are made for the improvement of the meter.</p>\n\n<p>The first edition contains 3201 lines; the second 3207. The theory\nand aim of the translation are not changed at all.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of Heyne’s Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>In this translation of the <i>Beowulf</i>, Heyne attempts to\npopularize what he considers the most beautiful of the Old English\npoems. He says of it—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Es ist nicht die erste, die <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"word is emphatic (gesperrt) in Heyne original\">ich</ins> biete; gleichwol hoffe\nich es werde die erste sein, die auch einem grössern Publicum, das noch\nnicht Gelegenheit hatte, sich mit den ältern Dialecten unserer Sprache\nzu beschäftigen, verständlich ist. Die ältern deutschen Uebersetzer\nhaben, bei allen Verdiensten ihrer Arbeit, unserer neuhochdeutschen\nMuttersprache teilweise übel mitgespielt.’ —Vorwort, iii.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this in view, Heyne put his translation out in a form that would\nmake it accessible to all. This was in itself an innovation. The works\nof Ettmüller<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne6\" id=\"tag_heyne6\" href=\"#note_heyne6\">6</a> and Simrock<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne7\" id=\"tag_heyne7\" href=\"#note_heyne7\">7</a> had been in a more\nelaborate <i>format</i>, while Grein’s translation<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_heyne8\" id=\"tag_heyne8\" href=\"#note_heyne8\">8</a> was not\nonly expensive, but encumbered with other work, and intended primarily\nfor the scholar.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Heyne chose a new medium for his version, the unrimed iambic line.\nHis aim being to get his book read, he avoided a literal translation,\nand rendered with commendable freedom, though not with inaccuracy. He\nused no strange compounds, and shunned an unnatural verse. Thus he\nproduced the most readable translation that has ever appeared in\nGermany. Of his own attempt he says—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Die vorliegende Uebertragung ist so frei, dass sie das für uns schwer\noder gar nicht genau nachzubildende <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘alliterierende’\">allitterierende</ins> Versmass des\nOriginals gegen fünffüssige <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘Iamben’\">Jamben</ins> aufgibt, und zu Gunsten des\n\nSinnes sich der angelsächsischen Wort- und Satzstellung nicht zu\nängstlich anschmiegt; dagegen auch wieder so genau, dass sie hoffentlich\nein Scherflein zum vollkommenern Verständniss des Textes beitragen\nwird.’ —Vorwort, iii.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Heyne’s theory of translation is one that has been very little in\nvogue in Germany. He has been criticized on all sides for his freedom.\nYet the criticism is undeserved. Heyne is never paraphrastic—he\nnever adds anything foreign to the poem. He merely believes in\ntranslating the obscure as well as the simple ideas of his text. His\n‘freedom’ seldom amounts to more than this—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>Hē bēot ne āleh, l. 80 (he belied not his promise)</p>\n<p>Was er gelobt, erfüllt er.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>He occasionally inserts a word for metrical reasons, and sometimes,\nin the interests of clearness, a demonstrative or personal pronoun,\nor even a proper name (cf. l. 500 of the extract).</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallroman\">IX.</h5>\n\n<div class=\"verse lines\">\n<span class=\"linenum\">500</span>\n<p>Da sagte Hunferd, Ecglafs Sohn, der Hrodgar</p>\n<p>zu Füssen sass, dem Herrn der Schildinge,</p>\n<p>des Streites Siegel löste er (denn sehr</p>\n<p>war Beowulfes Ankunft ihm verhasst,</p>\n<p>des kühnen Meerbefahrers; er vergönnte</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">505</span>\n<p>es Niemand, mehr des Ruhmes als er selber</p>\n<p>sich unterm Himmel jemals zu erwerben):</p>\n<p>‘Bist du der Beowulf, der einst mit Breca</p>\n<p>sich auf der weiten See im Schwimmkampf mass,</p>\n<p>als ihr euch kühnlich in die Tiefen stürztet,</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">510</span>\n<p>und mit <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘verwegnen’\">verwegnem</ins> Brüsten euer Leben</p>\n<p>im tiefen Wasser wagtet?

        "criticism": "<p>The extract illustrates sufficiently the characteristics of Heyne’s\nrendering. In the first place, attention may be called to the extreme\nfreedom of the verse, a freedom which at times makes the\ncomposition verge upon prose. In the second place, the translation of\nthe Old English phrase <i>beadu-runen onband</i> should be noticed, and\ncompared with the translations of Ettmüller, Grein, and Simrock, who\nhave respectively—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p><i>entband beadurunen</i></p>\n<p><i>entband Streitrunen</i></p>\n<p><i>Kampfrunen . . . entbinden.</i></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Heyne is the only one who translates the phrase in such a way as to\nmake the words intelligible to a reader unacquainted with Old English.\nFinally, it should be noticed that the translation is quite as accurate\nas those which preceded it. Heyne certainly succeeded in his attempt to\nmake the poem more intelligible to the general reader than it had ever\nbeen before. While not so serviceable to the scholar as Grein’s\ntranslation, it is undoubtedly the most enjoyable of the German\nversions.</p>",

There is no evidence that he had any <i>special</i>\ninterest in Old English studies.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>\n\n<p>As expressed in the ‘Vorbemerkung,’ the aim of the translator was\n(1) to provide a readable translation ‘für unser modernes\nPublicum,’ and (2) to make a convenient handbook for the student,\nso that the beginner, with Grein’s text<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_wolzogen1\" id=\"tag_wolzogen1\" href=\"#note_wolzogen1\">1</a> and\nthe present translation, might read the <i>Beowulf</i> with no very\ngreat difficulty.

Von Wolzogen is concerned for this feature\nof his work, and is at pains to\n\ngive what he considers a full account of the original verse as well as a\nlengthy defence of alliteration. Archaic touches are occasional.

A specimen of\nhis free interpretation of the <i>Beowulf</i> diction may be seen in the\nfootnote on page 13, where he defines <i>horngēap</i> (i.e. ‘with wide\nintervals between its pinnacles of horn’) as ‘hornreich,’ and translates\n<i>hornreced</i>, ‘Hornburg.’ Inaccurate renderings of the Old English\nhave been noted above in italics. They reveal an especial difficulty\nwith the kenning, a device which von Wolzogen apparently did not\nunderstand, since the entire translation shows an attempt to interpret\nthe kenning hypotactically. Had the translator been making a paraphrase,\ninaccuracies like ‘muthige Meerfahrt’ and ‘ihr rangt mit dem Wasser’\nmight be excused; but in a translation which was avowedly literal (more\nliteral than Heyne’s) they appear to be due to nothing less than\nignorance and carelessness.

The cesura is frequently not in evidence (cf. lines 14 and 22,\nboth of which are also metrically incorrect); the lines are often\ndeficient in length (p. 29, line 26; p. 31, line 19;\np. 32, line 19).</p>",

        "description": "Fourth English Translation. Prose.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>\n\n<p>No edition of the text of <i>Beowulf</i> had appeared in England\nsince the work of Thorpe<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold1\" id=\"tag_arnold1\" href=\"#note_arnold1\">1</a>, now twenty years\n\nold. The textual criticism of the Germans had, meanwhile, greatly\nadvanced the interpretation of the poem. Grein’s text of the poem had\npassed into a second, and Heyne’s into a third, edition. There was an\nopportunity, therefore, for an improved English edition which should\nincorporate the results of German scholarship. This edition Mr. Thomas\nArnold (1823–1900) undertook to supply.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Relation of the Parts.</h5>\n\n<p>The Introduction contained a new theory of the origin of the poem<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold2\" id=\"tag_arnold2\" href=\"#note_arnold2\">2</a>. But the important part of the book was the text\nand translation. There is no glossary<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold3\" id=\"tag_arnold3\" href=\"#note_arnold3\">3</a>. The notes\nare at the bottom of the page. Here glossarial, textual, and literary\ninformation is bundled together. There is a very inadequate bibliography\nin the Introduction.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is a literal prose version, printed under the text.\nIt resembles Kemble’s work<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold4\" id=\"tag_arnold4\" href=\"#note_arnold4\">4</a>, rather than Thorpe’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold5\" id=\"tag_arnold5\" href=\"#note_arnold5\">5</a>. It eschews unwieldy compounds, and makes no\nattempt to acquire an archaic flavor. Supplied words are bracketed.</p>\n\n\n<h5><a name=\"trans_arnold_crit\" id=\"trans_arnold_crit\">\nCriticism of the Text.</a></h5>\n\n<p>Arnold had access to the MS., and gave the most thorough description\nof it that had yet appeared. But, strangely enough, he did not make it\nthe basis of his edition. He speaks of a ‘partial collation’ of\nthe MS.,\n\nbut this appears to have been nothing <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text reads ‘mroe’\">more</ins> than a transcription of certain\nfragmentary parts of the MS. One of these passages is printed in the\nIntroduction, where it is referred to as an ‘exact transcript’; yet, in\ncollating it with the Zupitza <i>Autotypes</i>, I have found the\nfollowing errors:—</p>\n\n<table class=\"lines\" summary=\"details of translations\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Line 2219<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold6\" id=\"tag_arnold6\" href=\"#note_arnold6\">6</a>,</td>\n<td>þeowes <i>for</i> þeofes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2220,</td>\n<td>biorn <i>for</i> beorna.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2211,</td>\n<td>geweoldum <i>for</i> ge weoldum.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2223,</td>\n<td>b <i>for</i> þ.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2225,</td>\n<td>wea . . . <i>for</i> weal . . .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2226,</td>\n<td>inwlitode, inwatode <i>for</i> mwatide.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>Of course the faded condition of the MS. offers some excuse for one\nor two of these errors, but, if we encounter mistakes in a short\ntranscript professedly exact, what would have been the fate of the text\nhad the entire MS. been collated?</p>\n\n<p>Professor Garnett<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold7\" id=\"tag_arnold7\" href=\"#note_arnold7\">7</a> has noted that Arnold’s text\nwas taken from Thorpe’s, with some changes to suit the 1857 text of\nGrein. In order to test the accuracy of these statements I have made a\ncollation of the texts of Arnold, Thorpe, and the MS. The list of errors\nin Thorpe’s text, which I have mentioned in a discussion of that work<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold8\" id=\"tag_arnold8\" href=\"#note_arnold8\">8</a>, is repeated bodily in Arnold’s. Yet there was no\nexcuse at this time for the retention of many of these readings.\nGrundtvig<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold9\" id=\"tag_arnold9\" href=\"#note_arnold9\">9</a> had corrected several of them as early as 1861 by\nhis collation of the Thorkelin transcripts<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold10\" id=\"tag_arnold10\" href=\"#note_arnold10\">10</a>; Heyne\nhad got rid of them by collating Thorpe’s work with Kemble’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_arnold11\" id=\"tag_arnold11\" href=\"#note_arnold11\">11</a> and Grundtvig’s. Arnold makes almost no\n\nreference to the work of Heyne, and incorporates none of his\nemendations. He also overlooked Grein’s 1867 text, which contained new\nreadings and a glossary. Arnold himself did not emend the text in a\nsingle instance.</p>",

The\nexpedition of Beowulf, the valiant mariner, was to him a great cause of\noffence; for that he allowed not that any other man on the earth should\never appropriate more deeds of fame under heaven than he himself. ‘Art\nthou that Beowulf who strove against Breca in a swimming-match on the\nbroad sea? where ye two for emulation explored the waves, and for\nfoolish boasting ventured your lives in the deep water. Nor could any\nman, either friend or foe, warn you off from your perilous adventure.\nThen ye two rowed on the sea, where with your arms [outspread] ye\ncovered the ocean-stream, measured the sea-ways, churned up [the water]\nwith your hands, glided over the deep; the sea was tossing with waves,\nthe icy wintry sea. Ye two toiled for seven nights in the watery realm;\nhe overcame thee in the match, he had more strength. Then, at dawn of\nmorn, the sea cast him up on [the coast of] the Heathoreamas; thence he,\ndear in the sight of his people, sought his loved native soil, the land\nof the Brondings, the fair safe burgh where he was the owner of folk,\nburgh, and precious jewels.’ —Pages 37, 38.\n</blockquote>",

        "description": "First French Translation. Prose.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Old English Studies in France.</h5>\n\n<p>The only attention that <i>Beowulf</i> had received in France prior\nto this time was in the work of Sandras, <i>De Carminibus Cædmoni\nadiudicatis</i><a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine1\" id=\"tag_botkine1\" href=\"#note_botkine1\">1</a>. Other scholars, if they\ndevoted themselves to English at all, studied chiefly the later periods\nof the literature<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine2\" id=\"tag_botkine2\" href=\"#note_botkine2\">2</a>. In 1867 the author of the\narticle on <i>Beowulf</i> in Larousse’s Dictionary could say, ‘Le poème\nn’est pas connu en France.’ In 1876 Botkine published a historical and\ncritical analysis of the poem<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine3\" id=\"tag_botkine3\" href=\"#note_botkine3\">3</a>. This was the first\nscholarly attention that the poem received in France. In the following\nyear Botkine’s translation appeared.</p>\n\n<p>France has added nothing to our knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i>; there\nhas never been another translation, nor even a reprint of Botkine’s.\nThere has been no further scholarly work done on the poem; and the\nprincipal literary notices of it, such as Taine’s and Jusserand’s, have\nbeen notoriously unsympathetic. The genius of Old English poetry is at\nthe furthest possible remove from that of the French.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>It will be made evident in the section that follows on the nature of\nBotkine’s translation that his work could never\n\nhave been intended for scholars. Had it been so intended, the translator\nwould have rendered more literally. His introduction<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine4\" id=\"tag_botkine4\" href=\"#note_botkine4\">4</a>\nproves that the book was addressed to the general reader rather than the\nstudent of Old English.</p>\n\n<p>The Introduction deals with the nature of Old English poetry, and\nmakes historical and critical remarks on the <i>Beowulf</i>. There are\noccasional notes explanatory of the text.</p>\n\n<p>In his critical work the author is chiefly indebted to Grein<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine5\" id=\"tag_botkine5\" href=\"#note_botkine5\">5</a> and Heyne<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine6\" id=\"tag_botkine6\" href=\"#note_botkine6\">6</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation, which is in prose, is characterized, as the author\nhimself admits, by extreme freedom and occasional omission of words and\nphrases. The author’s defence of these may be given here:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Je crois devoir me disculper, en présentant cette première traduction\nfrançaise de Beowulf, du double reproche qui pourrait m’être adressé\nd’avoir supprimé des passages du poëme et de n’en avoir pas suffisamment\nrespecté la lettre. D’abord je dois dire que les passages que j’ai\nsupprimés (il y en a fort peu) sont ou très obscurs ou d’une superfluité\nchoquante. Ensuite, il m’a semblé qu’en donnant une certaine liberté à\nma traduction et en évitant autant que possible d’y mettre les redites\net les périphrases de l’original anglo-saxon, je la rendrais meilleure\net plus conforme à l’esprit véritable de l’œuvre. Est-ce sacrifier du\nreste la fidélité d’une traduction que d’épargner au public la lecture\nde détails le plus souvent bizarres et inintelligibles? N’est-il pas\nplus logique d’en finir de suite avec des artifices poétiques inconnus à\nnos littératures modernes, plutôt que de vouloir s’escrimer en vain à\nles reproduire en français? Et alors même qu’on poursuivrait jusqu’au\nbout une tâche si ingrate, pourrait-on se flatter en fin de compte\nd’avoir conservé au poëme son cachet si indiscutable d’originalité? Non\ncertes.’ —Avertissement, p. 3.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Il ne faut pas oublier que, la langue française différant complètement\n\npar ses racines de l’anglo-saxon, il ne m’a pas été permis d’éluder les\ndifficultés de l’original comme on a pu le faire parfois en anglais et\nen allemand.’ —Note, p. 4.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It has been customary, in speaking of the work of M. Botkine, to call\nattention to the numerous omissions. This is misleading. The passages\nwhich the translator has omitted are not the obscure episodes or the\nlong digressions, but the metaphors, the parenthetical phrases, and\nespecially kennings and similar appositives.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the original has:—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>Þǣr æt hȳðe stōd hringed-stefna</p>\n<p>īsig ond ūt-fūs. (l. 32 f.)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>which Botkine renders:—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nDans la porte se trouvait une barque bien équipée. (p. 29.)</p>\n\n<p>The principal passages which Botkine omits entirely are: 1002b-1008a;\n1057b-1062; 1263–1276; 1679–1686.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Text Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The author seems to have been well acquainted with the scholarly work\ndone on <i>Beowulf</i> up to his time. He mentions in his Notes the\ninterpretations of Grein, Grundtvig<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine7\" id=\"tag_botkine7\" href=\"#note_botkine7\">7</a>,\nEttmüller<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine8\" id=\"tag_botkine8\" href=\"#note_botkine8\">8</a>, Thorpe<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine9\" id=\"tag_botkine9\" href=\"#note_botkine9\">9</a>, and Kemble<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine10\" id=\"tag_botkine10\" href=\"#note_botkine10\">10</a>. He appears to follow, in general, the text of\nHeyne, not, however, invariably.</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallroman\">IX.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\nHunferth, fils d’Ecglaf, qui était assis aux pieds du prince des\nScyldingas, parla ainsi (l’expédition de Beowulf<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine11\" id=\"tag_botkine11\" href=\"#note_botkine11\">11</a> le\nremplissait de chagrin, parce qu’il ne voulait pas convenir qu’aucun\nhomme<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine12\" id=\"tag_botkine12\" href=\"#note_botkine12\">12</a> eût plus de gloire<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_botkine13\" id=\"tag_botkine13\" href=\"#note_botkine13\">13</a> que\nlui-même):\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘N’es-tu pas le Beowulf qui essaya ses forces à la nage sur la\n\nmer immense avec Breca quand, par bravade, vous avez tenté les flots et\nque vous avez follement hasardé votre vie dans l’eau profonde?

        "criticism": "<p>If the translation is compared with the text, the reader will be\nstruck by the characteristic beauty of the words omitted. We may agree\nwith the translator regarding the difficulty of rendering compound and\nkenning into French, and yet the very absence of an attempt to do this\njeopardizes the value of the translation more than the omission of many\nepisodes, for it brings it dangerously near to paraphrase. ‘Vous avez\nnagé alors sur la mer, vous avez suivi les sentiers de l’océan,’ cannot\npossibly be called a translation of—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p class=\"halfline\">\nþā git on sund rēon;</p>\n<p>þǣr git ēagor-strēam     earmum þehton,</p>\n<p>mǣton mere-strǣta, mundum brugdon,</p>\n<p>glidon ofer gār-secg.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"page\">\nll. 512, ff.</p>\n\n<p>A part of the story has been thrown away with the adjectives. The\nforce and beauty of the passage are gone.</p>\n\n<p>But there is another danger in this paraphrastic method. In omitting\nwords and phrases, the translator will often misinterpret his original.\nThis is especially true of Botkine’s work in the obscure episodes where\nhe wishes to make the meaning perfectly clear. In attempting to simplify\nthe Old English, he departs from the original\n\nsense. Instances of this may be brought forward from the Finn\nepisode:</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p class=\"halfline\">\nFolcwaldan sunu</p>\n<p>dōgra gehwylce Dene weorþode,</p>\n<p>Hengestes hēap hringum wenede,</p>\n<p>efne swā swīðe sinc-gestrēonum</p>\n<p>fǣttan goldes, swā hē Frēsena cyn</p>\n<p>on bēor-sele byldan wolde.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"page\">\nll. 1089 ff.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is misinterpreted in Botkine’s—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nLe fils de Folcwalda (stipulait qu’il) leur ferait chaque jour une\ndistribution de trésors.

        "description": "Fifth English Translation. Ballad Measures.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Differences between the two Editions, and Indebtedness to Preceding\nScholars.</h5>\n\n<p>In the first edition of the translation a number of passages were\nomitted. Some of these omissions were owing to corrupt text, some to\nextreme obscurity of the original, and some merely to the fact that the\noriginal was deemed uninteresting. The principal omissions were:\n83–86; 767–770; 1724–1758; 1931–1963;\n2061–2062; 2214–2231; 2475; 2930–2932;\n3150–3156. These passages were inserted in the second edition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘In this edition I have endeavoured to remove some of the blunders which\ndisfigured its predecessor. . . . Some parts have been\nentirely rewritten, and the passages formerly\nomitted . . . have been inserted. . . .\nA few notes have been added; and the introduction has been\nmaterially altered and, I hope, improved.’ —Preface to the\nSecond Edition, p. v.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Aim and Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Lumsden’s desire was to produce a readable version of the poem. Thus\nhis work resembles that of Wackerbarth<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_lumsden2\" id=\"tag_lumsden2\" href=\"#note_lumsden2\">2</a>; and,\nlike Wackerbarth, he couched his translation in ballad measures. Lumsden\ndoes not vary his measure, but preserves the iambic heptameter\nthroughout. His lines rime in couplets.</p>\n\n<p>No attempt is made to preserve alliteration or archaic diction.</p>\n\n<p>The Introduction and Notes contain popular expositions of the work of\npreceding scholars. Several of the Notes are original and well worth\nwhile (see Notes A, C, G, M).</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Texts Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is based on Grein’s text of 1857<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_lumsden3\" id=\"tag_lumsden3\" href=\"#note_lumsden3\">3</a> and\nArnold’s text (1876)<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_lumsden4\" id=\"tag_lumsden4\" href=\"#note_lumsden4\">4</a>. Garnett has shown<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_lumsden5\" id=\"tag_lumsden5\" href=\"#note_lumsden5\">5</a> that Lumsden ignored the 1867 text of Grein and\nthe editions of Heyne. These defects were remedied to some extent in the\nsecond edition. Lumsden himself never emends the text.</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallcaps\">IV. Hunferd and Beowulf.</h5>\n\n<div class=\"verse lines\">\n<p>Hunferd the son of Ecglaf spoke—at Hrothgar’s feet\nsat he—</p>\n<p>And thus let loose his secret grudge; (for much did him displease</p>\n<p>The coming of Beowulf now—bold sailor o’er the seas.</p>\n<p>To none on earth would he allow a greater fame ’mong men</p>\n<p>Beneath the heavens than his): ‘Art thou the same Beowulf then,</p>\n<p>Who swam a match with Breca once upon the waters wide,</p>\n<p>When ye vainglorious searched the waves, and risked your lives for\npride</p>\n<p>Upon the deep? Nor hinder you could any friend or foe</p>\n<p>From that sad venture. Then ye twain did on the waters row;</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">10</span>\n<p>Ye stretched your arms upon the flood; the sea-ways ye did mete;</p>\n<p>O’er billows glided—with your hands them tossed—though\nfiercely beat</p>\n<p>The rolling tides and wintry waves! Seven nights long toilèd ye</p>\n<p>In waters’ might; but Breca won—he stronger was than thee!</p>\n<p>And to the Hathoræms at morn washed shoreward by the flood,</p>\n<p>Thence his loved native land he sought—the Brondings’ country\ngood,</p>\n<p>And stronghold fair, where he was lord of folk and burg and\nrings.</p>\n<p>Right well ’gainst thee his vaunt he kept.</p>\n</div>",
        "criticism": "<p>The extract illustrates the paraphrastic nature of parts of the\ntranslation. Lumsden frequently seems to feel it necessary to read a\nmeaning into the obscure lines and\n\npassages that do not easily lend themselves to translation; cf. lines\n11, 12. At line 2258 Lumsden translates:—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse lines\">\n<p class=\"halfline\">\nThe mail that bite of sword</p>\n<p>O’er clashing shield in fight withstood must follow its dead\nlord.</p>\n<p>Never again shall corselet ring as help the warriors bear</p>\n<p>To comrades far.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Old English from which this passage is taken reads:—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse lines\">\n<p>ge swylce sēo here-pād,     sīo æt hilde gebād</p>\n<p>ofer borda gebræc     bite īrena,</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">2260</span>\n<p>brosnað æfter beorne;     ne mæg byrnan hring</p>\n<p>æfter wīg-fruman     wīde fēran</p>\n<p>hæleðum be healfe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The passage is certainly obscure, and the readings are not all\nundoubted, but the words can never be tortured into meaning what Lumsden\ntries to make them mean.</p>\n\n<p>But it would be manifestly unfair to judge a translation addressed to\nthe general reader merely by scholarly tests. The work must make its\nappeal as a literary rendering.</p>\n\n<p>The propriety of adopting a ballad measure may be questioned.\nProbably no measure could be found more unlike the Old English lines.\nMoreover, by reason of its long association with purely popular poetry,\nit constantly suggests the commonplace and the trivial. But above all,\nit is reminiscent of a medievalism wholly different from that of\n<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The saving grace of the ballad measure is its readableness. It is\nrather effective in passages not too dignified, calling for action. But\nin passages of elevation the line is found wanting:—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>They mourned their king and chanted dirge, and much of him they\nsaid;</p>\n<p>His worthiness they praised, and judged his deeds with tender\ndread.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>But, like Wackerbarth’s, Lumsden’s translation had the advantage of\nbeing readable.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Differences between the Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>In the second edition the translation was collated with the\nGrein-Wülker text, and wherever necessary, with the Zupitza\n<i>Autotypes</i>. Additions were made to the bibliography:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘I have revised certain passages with a view to greater accuracy, but I\nhave not changed the plan of the work, for that would have necessitated\nthe re-writing of the whole translation.’ —Preface to the second\nedition.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The third and fourth editions are simple reprints, with some\nadditions to the bibliography.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>\n\n<p>As has been pointed out above in the sections on Arnold<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_garnett1\" id=\"tag_garnett1\" href=\"#note_garnett1\">1</a> and Lumsden<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_garnett2\" id=\"tag_garnett2\" href=\"#note_garnett2\">2</a>, no satisfactory\nliteral translation of <i>Beowulf</i> existed in English. Furthermore,\nan American translation had never appeared. It was with a view to\npresenting the latest German interpretations of the poem\n\nthat Garnett prepared his literal version of the poem. The original\ndraft of the translation was made at St. John’s College, Md., in the\nsession of 1878–79.—Preface to first edition.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Texts Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is based on Grein’s text of 1867. Notes are added\nshowing the variants from Heyne’s text of 1879. In the second edition\nnotes are added showing the variants from the Grein-Wülker text of\n1883.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Method of Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is intended for ‘the general reader’ and for the ‘aid\nof students of the poem.’ —Preface to second edition.</p>\n\n<p>The translation is a literal line-for-line version. Of this feature\nof his work Professor Garnett says:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘This involves naturally much inversion and occasional obscurity, and\nlacks smoothness; but it seemed to me to give the general reader a\nbetter idea of the poem than a mere prose translation would do, in\naddition to the advantage of literalness. While it would have been easy,\nby means of periphrasis and freer translation, to mend some of the\ndefects chargeable to the line-for-line form, the translation would have\nlacked literalness, which I regarded as the most important object.’\n—Preface to the first edition.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Verse-form.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ins class=\"correction\" title=\"open quote invisible\">‘In</ins>\nrespect to the rhythmical form, I have endeavored to preserve two\naccents to each half-line, with cæsura, and while not seeking\nalliteration, have employed it purposely wherever it readily presented\nitself. I considered that it mattered little whether the feet were\niambi or trochees, anapæsts or dactyls, the preservation of the two\naccents being the main point, and have freely made use of all the usual\nlicences in Early English verse. . . . To attain this\npoint I have sometimes found it necessary to place unemphatic words in\naccented positions, and words usually accented in unaccented ones, which\nlicence can also be found in Early English verse. . . .\nWhile the reader of modern English verse may sometimes be offended by\nthe ruggedness of the\n\nrhythm, it is hoped that the Anglo-Saxon scholar will make allowances\nfor the difficulty of reproducing, even approximately, the rhythm of the\noriginal. The reproduction of the sense as closely as possible had to be\nkept constantly in view, even to the detriment of the smoothness of the\nrhythm.’ —Preface to the first edition.\n</blockquote>",

        "criticism": "<p>The translation, in its revised form, is throughout a faithful\nversion of the original text. The fault of Garnett’s\n\ntranslation is the fault of all merely literal\ntranslations—inadequacy to render fully the content of the\noriginal. The rendering may be word for word, but it will not be idea\nfor idea. Examples of this inadequacy may be given from the printed\nextract. ‘Grief’ in line 502 is a very insufficient rendering of\n<i>æf-þunca</i>, a unique word which suggests at once vexation,\nmortification, and jealousy. Had the poet simply meant to express the\nnotion of <i>grief</i>, he would have used <i>sorh</i>, <i>cearu</i>, or\nsome other common word. In line 508 ‘pride’ hardly gives full expression\nto the idea of <i>wlence,</i> which signifies not only <i>pride</i>, but\n<i>vain pride, of empty end</i>. In line 517 ‘conquered’ is insufficient\nas a translation of <i>oferflāt</i>, which means to <i>overcome in\nswimming, to outswim</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of this sort can be brought forward from any part of the\npoem. At line 2544 Garnett translates—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nStruggles of battle when warriors contended,</p>\n\n<p>a translation of—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nGūða . . . þonne hnitan fēðan</p>\n\n<p>Here ‘hnitan fēðan’ refers to the swift clash in battle of two armed\nhosts, a notion which is ill borne out by the distributive\n‘warriors’ and the vague ‘contended.’</p>\n\n<p>At line 2598 we find—</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nthey to wood went</p>\n\n<p>for</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nhȳ on holt bugon,</p>\n\n<p>which, whatever be the meaning of ‘bugon,’ is surely a misleading\ntranslation.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the verse has been sufficiently illustrated by the\nquotations from the author’s preface. It would seem from the way in\nwhich the measure is used that it was a kind of second thought, incident\nupon the use of a line-for-line translation. It is hard to read the\nlines as\n\nanything but prose, and, if they appeared in any other form upon the\npage, it is to be questioned whether any one would have guessed that\nthey were intended to be imitative.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Reception of Garnett’s Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Garnett’s volume had a flattering reception. The book received long\nand respectful reviews from the Germans. Professor Child and Henry Sweet\nexpressed their approbation. The book has passed through four editions.\nThis cordial welcome has been due in large measure to the increasing\nattention given the poem in American colleges and secondary schools.\nBeing strictly literal, the book has been of value as a means of\ninterpreting the poem.</p>",

A translation out of an ancient tongue ought never to\nstrive after archaic flavor in point of words and expressions. Since the\npoet wrote in the language of his day, the translation ought also to use\ncontemporary language. . . . I have tried to follow\nthe original faithfully, but not slavishly. For the sake of clearness\nthe half-lines have often been transposed. . . . The\nrhythm is still more irregular than the Old English. Alliteration has\ngenerally been avoided.’ —Inledning, p. 6.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Texts Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The author constructs his own text. He explains (p. 6) that he\nhas in general taken the MS. as the basis of his text.

In the meantime Heyne’s text<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle2\" id=\"tag_earle2\" href=\"#note_earle2\">2</a> had passed\ninto a fifth edition (1888); Wülker’s revision of Grein’s\n<i>Bibliothek</i> had appeared with a new text of <i>Beowulf</i> (1881);\nZupitza’s <i>Autotypes</i> of the MS. had appeared 1882, making it\npossible to ascertain exactly what was in the original text of the poem;\nthe studies of Sievers<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle3\" id=\"tag_earle3\" href=\"#note_earle3\">3</a>, Cosijn<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle4\" id=\"tag_earle4\" href=\"#note_earle4\">4</a>, Kluge<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle5\" id=\"tag_earle5\" href=\"#note_earle5\">5</a>, and Bugge<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle6\" id=\"tag_earle6\" href=\"#note_earle6\">6</a> had been published, containing\nmasterly discussions of text revision. Some of these materials had been\nused by Garnett in his translation, but the majority of them were of\nlater date.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Nothing is said in the introduction respecting the aim of the\ntranslation; but it is evident from the Notes that the purpose was\ntwofold—to present the latest interpretation of the text, and to\nafford a literary version of the poem.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Texts Used.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘This translation was originally made from the Fourth Edition of Moritz\nHeyne’s text. His Fifth Edition came out in 1888, and I think I have\nused it enough to become acquainted with all the changes that Dr. Adolf\nSocin, the new editor, has introduced. Where they have appeared to me to\nbe improvements, I have modified my translation accordingly.’\n—Preface.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the translator does not depend slavishly upon his text. He\nfrequently uses emendations suggested by the scholars mentioned above,\nespecially those of Professor\n\nSophus Bugge in <i>Studien über das Beowulfsepos</i><a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle7\" id=\"tag_earle7\" href=\"#note_earle7\">7</a>; see\nlines 457, 871, 900, 936, 1875, 2275.</p>\n\n<p>The Introduction presents a new theory of the origin of the poem. The\nnotes are especially interesting because of the large body of quotations\ncited for literary comparison and for the light they throw on Old\nGermanic and medieval customs.</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallroman\">VIII.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>Unferth the king’s orator is jealous. He baits the young adventurer,\nand in a scoffing speech dares him to a night-watch for Grendel. Beowulf\nis angered, and thus he is drawn out to boast of his youthful feats.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnferth made a speech, Ecglaf’s son; he who sate at the feet of the\nScyldings’ lord, broached a quarrelsome theme—the adventure of\nBeowulf the high-souled voyager was great despite to him, because he\ngrudged that any other man should ever in the world achieve more\nexploits under heaven than he himself:— ‘Art thou <i>that</i>\nBeowulf, he who strove with Breca on open sea in swimming-match, where\nye twain out of bravado explored the floods, and foolhardily in deep\nwater jeoparded your lives? nor could any man, friend or foe, turn the\npair of you from the dismal adventure! What time ye twain plied in\nswimming, where ye twain covered with your arms the awful stream, meted\nthe sea-streets, buffeted with hands, shot over ocean; the deep boiled\nwith waves, a wintry surge. Ye twain in the realm of waters toiled\na se’nnight; he at swimming outvied thee, had greater force. Then in\nmorning hour the swell cast him ashore on the Heathoram people, whence\nhe made for his own patrimony, dear to his Leeds he made for the land of\nthe Brondings, a fair stronghold, where he was lord of folk, of\ncity, and of rings. All his boast to thee-ward, Beanstan’s son soothly\nfulfilled. Wherefore I anticipate for thee worse luck—though thou\nwert everywhere doughty in battle-shocks, in grim war-tug—if thou\ndarest bide in Grendel’s way a night-long space.’\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>As a whole, the translation may fairly be called faithful. The\nemendations from which Professor Earle sometimes\n\nrenders are always carefully chosen, and the discussions of obscure\nlines in the poem are of real scholarly interest. But this is not always\ntrue of the simpler passages of the poem. These are often strained to\nmake them square with the translator’s personal notions. Thus, at line\n1723, Earle reads for</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p><i>Ic þis gid be þē āwraec</i></p>\n<p>It is about thee . . . that I have told this tale,</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>adding in a note, ‘(In this passage) the living poet steps forward\nout of his Hrothgar, and turns his eyes to the prince for whom he made\nit up’ (p. 168). Now this is nothing more than an attempt on the\npart of the translator to wring from the Old English lines some scrap of\nproof for the peculiar theory that he holds of the origin of the\npoem.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, he often reads into a single word more than it can\npossibly bear. At line 371 he translates—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p><i>Hrothgar, helm Scyldinga,</i></p>\n<p>Hrothgar, crown of Scyldings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>But ‘crown’ is an impossible rendering of ‘helm,’ which is here used\nfiguratively to denote the idea of protection<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_earle8\" id=\"tag_earle8\" href=\"#note_earle8\">8</a>, rather than\nthe idea of the crowning glory of kingship. Further, in the same\npassage, 375–6, <i>heard eafora</i> (bold son), is wrenched into\nmeaning ‘grown-up son.’ These are but two examples of what is common\nthroughout the translation.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Diction.</h5>\n\n<p>The archaic style used by Professor Earle cannot be regarded as\nhighly felicitous, since it mixes the diction of various ages. Here are\nOld English archaisms like\n\n‘Leeds’ and ‘burnie’; here are expressions like ‘escheat,’ ‘page’\n(attendant), ‘emprize,’ ‘bombard’ (drinking-vessel), ‘chivalry.’ Here\nare such specialized words as ‘harpoon,’ ‘belligerent,’ ‘pocket-money,’\nand combinations like ‘battailous grip’; while throughout the entire\ntranslation are scattered modern colloquialisms like ‘boss’ (master),\n‘tussle,’ ‘war-tug.’</p>\n\n<p>The reason for these anomalies is evident—the translator wishes\nto imitate the remoteness of the original style. The style is certainly\nremote—at times almost as remote from the language of to-day as is\nthe style of <i>Beowulf</i> itself.</p>",

        "criticism": "<p>The translation is faithful, but not literal. The chief difference,\nfor example, between this and the translation by Garnett is that Hall\nmakes an attempt to preserve the poetic value of the Old English words.\nHe is never satisfied with the dictionary equivalent of an Old English\nexpression. Thus, in the extract given above, ‘from vainest vaunting’ is\ngiven as a translation of <i>dol-gilpe</i>—a great\nimprovement over Garnett’s rendering, ‘for pride.’ Similarly, ‘mixing\nand stirring’ is given as a translation of <i>mundum brugdon</i>. This\nmethod often leads the translator some distance, perhaps too great a\ndistance, from the Old English. The following may serve as examples of\nthe heightened color that Hall gives to the Old English\nforms:—</p>\n\n<table class=\"lines\" summary=\"details of translations\">\n<tbody><tr><td>\n<p>548, ‘the north-wind whistled, fierce in our faces,’ for\n<i>norþan-wind heaðo-grim ondhwearf</i>.</p>\n\n<p>557, ‘my obedient blade,’ for <i>hilde-bille</i>.</p>\n\n<p>568, ‘foam-dashing currents,’ for <i>brontne ford</i>.</p>\n\n<p>587, ‘with cold-hearted cruelty thou killedst thy brothers,’ for\n<i>ðū þīnum brōðrum tō banan wurde</i>.</p>\n\n<p>606, ‘the sun in its ether robes,’ for <i>sunne swegl-wered</i>.</p>\n\n<p>838, ‘in the mist of the morning,’ for <i>on morgen</i>.</p>\n\n<p>1311, ‘As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,’ for\n<i>ǣr-dæge</i>.</p>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>Perhaps these paraphrastic renderings are what Dr. Hall is referring\nto when he says in his preface, regarding the nature of the translation,\n‘Occasionally some loss has been sustained; but, on the other hand,\na gain has here and there been made<ins class=\"correction\" title=\"close quote missing\">.’ </ins></p>\n\n<p>As for the archaism, that is well enough for those who like it. It is\nnever so strange as that of Earle, or the marvelous diction of William\nMorris. But it is not, therefore,\n\ndignified or clear. How much dignity and clarity a translator has a\nright to introduce into his rendering is a matter of opinion. Mr. Hall\nwas quite conscious of what he was doing, and doubtless regarded his\ndiction as well suited to convey the original Beowulf spirit.</p>\n\n<p>The chief criticism of the verse is that it is often not verse at\nall.

Professor’\nof Philosophy and Pedagogy at Gent.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>\n\n<p>The translator desired to present a rendering of the poem that should\nattract the general reader. He regarded Simrock’s version as too literal\nand archaic<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann1\" id=\"tag_hoffmann1\" href=\"#note_hoffmann1\">1</a>, the version of von Wolzogen as not\nsufficiently clear and beautiful<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann2\" id=\"tag_hoffmann2\" href=\"#note_hoffmann2\">2</a>, and the version of\nHeyne as not sufficiently varied in form<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann3\" id=\"tag_hoffmann3\" href=\"#note_hoffmann3\">3</a>\n(Vorwort, i). He regards the <i>Beowulf</i> as of great importance\nin inspiring patriotism—he always calls the poem German—and\neven offers a comparison of <i>Beowulf</i> with Emperor William I. With\nthe scholarship of his subject the author hardly seems concerned.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Text, and Relation of Parts.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is founded on Grein’s text of 1867<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann4\" id=\"tag_hoffmann4\" href=\"#note_hoffmann4\">4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the translation, the volume contains articles on the\nhistory of the text, origin, the Germanic hero-tales, the episodes, the\nesthetic value of the poem.

Archaisms\nand unnatural compounds are avoided.</p>\n\n<p>The Finnsburg fragment is inserted in the text at line 1068,\np. 44 of the volume.

        "criticism": "<p>Hoffmann’s translation is certainly not a contribution to\nscholarship. It is a sufficient condemnation of the volume to quote the\nwords of the Vorwort:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Die Uebersetzungen von Grein, Holder und Möller sind mir nicht\nzugänglich gewesen, auch wie es scheint, nicht sehr bekannt.’\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is not surprising that Hoffmann is unacquainted with the\ntranslations of Holder and Möller, as these works have\n\nnever been made; but that a German translator should ignore the version\nof Grein is a revelation indeed.</p>\n\n<p>Even though a translator may not care to embody in his work any new\ninterpretations, it is nevertheless his duty to base his translation on\nthe best text that he can find. But apparently Hoffmann had never heard\nof the Heyne editions of the text, nor of the Grein-Wülker\n<i>Bibliothek</i>. He bases his translation on Grein’s text of 1867. He\nevidently considered it a sufficient recommendation of his work to\nassociate with it the name of Grein, not troubling himself to discover\nwhat advance had been made upon the work of that scholar.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of antiquated renderings may be brought forward:—</p>\n\n<table class=\"lines\" summary=\"details of translations\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td class=\"number\">P. 1,</td>\n<td>line 1, Wie grosse Ruhmesthaten.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">2,</td>\n<td><p>line 1, So soll mit Gaben werben im Vaterhause schon.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">21,</td>\n<td><p>line 15 (see Extract), Vom Wintersturm getrieben Hoch auf die\nWellen schäumten.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">84,</td>\n<td>line 3, Mothrytho.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>Petty inaccuracies due to the nature of the translation also appear.\nAn example of this is seen on page 3, at the opening of the first\ncanto—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p class=\"indent\">\nUeber Burg und Mannen nun herrschte manches Jahr</p>\n<p>Beówulf der Schilding. Wie hold dem König war</p>\n<p>Sein Volk! in allen Landen seinen Ruhm man pries</p>\n<p>Als lange schon sein Vater von dieser Erde Leben liess.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<h5>Literary Criticism.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation resembles the work of Lumsden<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann5\" id=\"tag_hoffmann5\" href=\"#note_hoffmann5\">5</a> and\nWackerbarth<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_hoffmann6\" id=\"tag_hoffmann6\" href=\"#note_hoffmann6\">6</a> in affording a version of the tale easily\nreadable. And the same criticism may be passed on the work of Hoffmann\nthat was passed on the two Englishmen.\n\nThe style and medium chosen are not well fitted to render the spirit of\nthe poem. The <i>Nibelungenlied</i> is a poem of the late twelfth\ncentury. The <i>Beowulf</i> at latest belongs to the eighth. To choose\nfor the translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, therefore, a medium\nsurcharged with reminiscence of a time, place, and style quite different\nfrom those of the original is certainly an error. It may find an\naudience where another and more faithful rendering would fail; but it\nwill never win the esteem of scholars. In his introduction Hoffmann\ncalls attention to the lack of variety in blank verse, but surely it\ndoes not have the monotony inherent in a recurring rime and strophe.</p>\n\n<p>Again, rime and strophe force upon the author the use of words and\nphrases needed to pad out the verse or stanza. Attention must also be\ncalled to the fact that the original seldom affords a natural pause at\nthe exact point demanded by the use of a strophic form. See the close of\nthe following stanzas in the Extract: I, III, IV, V. One effect of the\nforced pause is that there is confusion in the use of kennings, which\noften have to do duty as subject in one stanza and as object in another\nstanza.</p>\n\n<p>Commonplace expressions, incident perhaps upon the use of the\nmeasure, are not unfrequent. Thus</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nGesagt! gethan!</p>\n\n<p>translates</p>\n\n<p class=\"verse\">\nond þæt geæfndon swā (line 538).</p>\n\n<p>Traces of this are also found in the extract; see beginning of last\nstanza.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it may be said that Hoffmann’s version marks an\nadvance in one way only, readableness; and in this it is hardly superior\nto Heyne’s rendering, which has the advantage of scholarship.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>In the second edition a title-page is added. The running commentary,\nprinted in rubric on the margin of the first edition, is omitted.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Text Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is, in general, conformed to Wyatt’s text of 1894,\ndeparting from it in only a few unimportant details.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Part Taken in the Work by Morris and Wyatt respectively.</h5>\n\n<p>The matter is fortunately made perfectly clear in Mackail’s <i>Life\nof William Morris</i>, vol. ii. p. 284:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘(Morris) was not an Anglo-Saxon scholar, and to help him in following\nthe original, he used the aid of a prose translation made for him by Mr.\nA. J. Wyatt, of Christ’s College, Cambridge, with whom he had also read\nthrough the original. The plan of their joint\n\nlabours had been settled in the autumn of 1892. Mr. Wyatt began to\nsupply Morris with his prose paraphrase in February, 1893, and he at\nonce began to “rhyme up,” as he said, “very eager to be at it, finding\nit the most delightful work.” He was working at it all through the year,\nand used to read it to Burne-Jones regularly on Sunday mornings in\nsummer.’\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The plan of joining with his own the name of his principal teacher\nwas one which Morris had used before when translating from a foreign\ntongue. He published his rendering of the <i>Volsunga Saga</i> as the\nwork of ‘Eirikr Magnússon and William Morris.’ There is no evidence that\nMr. Wyatt had any hand in forming the final draft of the translation. In\ndefending it, Morris took all the responsibility for the book upon\nhimself, and he always spoke of it as his own work. In writing to a\nGerman student toward the end of his life Morris spoke of the\ntranslation as his own without mentioning Mr. Wyatt<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_morris_wyatt1\" id=\"tag_morris_wyatt1\" href=\"#note_morris_wyatt1\">1</a>. Nor has Mr. Wyatt shown a disposition to\nclaim a share in the work. In the preface to his edition of the text of\n<i>Beowulf</i> (Cambridge, 1894), he says:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Mr. William Morris has taken the text of this edition as the basis of\nhis modern metrical rendering of the lay.’ —Page xiii.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, it may be added that the specimens of Mr. Wyatt’s\ntranslation printed in the glossary and notes of his book bear no\nresemblance to the work of Morris.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Morris’s Theory of Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>None despised the merely literal rendering of an epic poem more than\nWilliam Morris. In writing of his version of the <i>Odyssey</i> to\nEllis, Morris said: ‘My translation is a real one so far, not a mere\nperiphrase of the original as <i>all</i> the others are.’ In translating\nan ancient poem, he tried to reproduce the simplicity and remoteness of\nphrase which he found in his original. He believed it possible,\n\ne.g., to suggest the archaic flavor of Homer by adopting a diction that\nbore the same relation to modern English that the language of Homer bore\nto that of the age of Pericles. The archaism of the English would\nrepresent the archaism of the Greek. This method he used in rendering\nVergil and Homer.</p>\n\n<p>But when he approached the translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, he was\nconfronted by a new problem. It was evident that fifteenth-century\nEnglish was ill-adapted to convey any just notion of eighth-century\nEnglish. <i>Beowulf</i> required a diction older than that of Sir Thomas\nMalory or Chaucer. Hence it became necessary to discard the theory\naltogether, or else to produce another style which should in some true\nsense be imitative of <i>Beowulf</i>. This latter Morris tried to\naccomplish by increasing the archaism of his style by every means in his\npower. This feature is discussed in the following section.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation of <i>Beowulf</i> is written in extremely archaic\nlanguage. An imitative measure of four principal stresses is used.\nWherever possible, the Old English syntax has been preserved (see line\n1242); the word-order of the original is retained. The archaic language\nis wrought of several different kinds of words. In the first place,\nthere is the ‘legitimate archaism,’ such as ‘mickle,’ ‘burg,’ ‘bairn’;\nthere are forms which are more closely associated with the translation\nof Old English, such as ‘middle-garth,’ ‘ring-stem.’ There are modern\nwords used with the old signification, such as ‘kindly’ (in the sense\n‘of the same kind’), ‘won war’ (in the sense ‘wage war’), ‘fret’ (in the\nsense ‘eat’). Finally, there are forms which are literally translated\nfrom Old English: ‘the sight seen once only’ from <i>ansȳn</i>, face,\n251; ‘spearman’ from <i>garsecg</i>, ocean (see extract), ‘gift-scat’\nfrom <i>gif-sceatt</i>, gift of money,\n\n378; ‘the Maker’s own making’ from <i>metod-sceaft</i>, doom, 1180.\nRomance words are excluded whenever possible. A glossary of ‘some\nwords not commonly used now’ is included in the book, but none of the\nwords cited above, save ‘burg,’ is found in it.</p>",
        "extract": "<h5 class=\"smallcaps\">IX. Unferth contendeth in words with\nBeowulf.</h5>\n\n<div class=\"verse lines\">\n<p class=\"indent\">\nSpake out then Unferth that bairn was of Ecglaf,</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">500</span>\n<p>And he sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,</p>\n<p>He unbound the battle-rune; was Beowulf’s faring,</p>\n<p>Of him the proud mere-farer, mickle unliking,</p>\n<p>Whereas he begrudg’d it of any man other</p>\n<p>That he glories more mighty the middle-garth over</p>\n<p>Should hold under heaven than he himself held:</p>\n<p class=\"indent\">\nArt thou that Beowulf who won strife with Breca</p>\n<p>On the wide sea contending in swimming,</p>\n<p>When ye two for pride’s sake search’d out the floods</p>\n<p>And for a dolt’s cry into deep water</p>\n<span class=\"linenum\">510</span>\n<p>Thrust both your life-days?

What to theeward he boasted,</p>\n<p>Beanstan’s son, for thee soothly he brought it about.</p>\n</div>",
        "criticism": "<p>The Morris-Wyatt translation is thoroughly accurate, and is, so to\nspeak, an official commentary on the text\n\nof Wyatt’s edition. It is therefore of importance to the student of the\n<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>\n\n<p>As a literary rendering the translation is disappointing. In the\nfirst place, it must be frankly avowed that the diction is frequently so\nstrange that it seems to modern readers well-nigh ridiculous. There are\ncertain sentences which cannot but evoke a smile. Such are:\n‘(he) spoke a word backward,’ line 315; ‘them that in Scaney dealt\nout the scat,’ line 1686.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the translation is unreadable. There is an avalanche of\narchaisms. One example of the extreme obscurity may be given:—</p>\n\n<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>‘Then rathe was beroom’d, as the rich one was bidding,</p>\n<p>For the guests a-foot going the floor all withinward.’</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"page\">\nl. 1975–76.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that the burden of ‘rathe,’ ‘beroomed,’ and\n‘withinward,’ were sufficient for any sentence to carry, but we are left\nto discover for ourselves that ‘rich one’ does not mean rich one, but\nruler, that the ‘floor’ is not a floor but a hall, and that the guests\nare not guests, but the ruler’s own men.</p>\n\n<p>Morris himself was conscious of the obscurity of the work:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘For the language of his version Morris once felt it necessary to make\nan apology. Except a few words, he said, the words used in it were such\nas he would not hesitate to use in an original poem of his own. He did\nnot add, however, that their effect, if slipped sparingly in amid his\nown pellucid construction and facile narrative method, would be very\ndifferent from their habitual use in a translation. . . .\nAs the work advanced, he seems to have felt this himself, and his\npleasure in the doing of it fell off.’ —Mackail’s <i>Life</i>, ii.\n284–5.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, the version does not <i>translate</i>. Words like ‘Spearman’\nfor <i>Ocean</i>, and combinations like ‘the sight seen once only’ for\n<i>the face</i>, can be understood only by the intimate student of Old\nEnglish poetry, and there is no reason why such a person should not\nperuse <i>Beowulf</i> in\n\nthe original tongue rather than in a translation occasionally as obscure\nas the poem itself.</p>\n\n<p>If one can peer through the darkness of Morris’s diction, he will\ndiscover a fairly pleasing use of the so-called imitative measure. The\nverse is not nearly so rough as the original; many of the characteristic\nsubstitutions are avoided. There is evident a tendency toward the\n‘rising verse’ and the anapestic foot. The feminine ending is frequently\nused. The verse is, therefore, not strictly imitative in that it retains\nthe Old English system of versification, but rather in that it attempts\nto suggest the Old English movement by the use of four principal\nstresses and a varying number of unstressed syllables. Morris’s verse is\nthe best of all the ‘imitative’ measures.</p>",

        "criticism": "<p>It would be manifestly unfair to criticize this translation for its\nwant of grace and melody, because it is avowedly a literal rendering,\nand a literal rendering makes no attempt to attain these qualities. But\nthere are certain things which are indispensable in a good literal\ntranslation. It is imperative that such a translation should be based on\nthe best text of the original poem. What has Steineck done? He has gone\nback thirty-five years and chosen an early and inaccurate edition of a\nwork that has been five times re-edited, Heyne’s text of 1863! It seems\nalmost incredible that a German, living in the midst of scholars who\nhave done more than any other people to interpret the <i>Beowulf</i>,\nshould ignore the fruits of their efforts.</p>\n\n<p>It is unnecessary to enumerate the faults of this translation due to\ndependence upon an antiquated edition of the text. Suffice it to say\nthat when the edition of 1863 was printed the text had not yet been\nproperly transcribed from the MS.<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_steineck2\" id=\"tag_steineck2\" href=\"#note_steineck2\">2</a></p>\n\n<p>But there are evidences of an inaccuracy of a different kind that\nbetray a carelessness utterly reprehensible. The\n\nauthor is apparently unable to transliterate properly the Old English\nnames. Thus he has Vealhpeon and Vealhpeo (for Wealhtheow), Ecgpeow,\nHalbdaene (for Healfdene), Ermanarich, &amp;c.</p>\n\n<p>In his attempt to produce an etymological document, the translator\nuses many compounds such as even the German language might be better\nwithout; such are—Sippenschar (sibbegedriht), 730; Schattenwandler\n(sceadugenga), 704; Wangenpolster (hlēor-bolster), 689; Leibpanzer\n(līc-syrce), 550. As compounds these may not be offensive to a German;\nbut the trouble with them is that they do not translate the Old English\nideas.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it may be asked why a translation that appeals only as a\nliteral rendering should not be strictly literal, noting its every\nvariation from the original, italicizing supplied words, holding to the\noriginal word-order.</p>\n\n<p>Steineck’s translation did not advance the interpretation of\n<i>Beowulf</i> a whit.

Moreover, this translation was the\nfirst to embody the results of various studies on the poem during the\npast decade.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Contents.</h5>\n\n<p>Unlike the preceding works on <i>Beowulf</i>, it may be said that the\nintroductory and illustrative matter in this book is of quite as much\nimportance as the translation. The author says of his book:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The following pages comprise a short statement of what is actually\nknown with respect to the poem of <i>Beowulf</i>, another statement of\nwhat seems to me most likely to be true amongst the almost innumerable\nmatters of conjecture concerning it, and a few words of literary\nappreciation.’ —Introduction, p. ix.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Statements similar to these have been put forth by other translators\nof the poem, but the material of their volume has not always borne them\nout. The studies of the poem in the Introduction are sufficient for a\nschool edition of <i>Beowulf</i>—a similar body of\ninformation is not found in any of the existing editions—while\nannotations of some importance to the elementary student are found in\nthe notes and running comment. The book contains, beside the\ntranslation, a discussion of the form, language, geographical\nallusions, date, and composition of the poem, as well as a useful,\nthough inaccurate, bibliography<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_jrc_hall3\" id=\"tag_jrc_hall3\" href=\"#note_jrc_hall3\">3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Text Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is founded on the text of A. J. Wyatt, Cambridge,\n1894. Dr. Hall does not always follow the interpretations given in\nWyatt’s glossary, nor is the punctuation of the translation conformed to\nthat of the Old English text.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars.</h5>\n\n<p>In his translation Dr. Hall seems to be most indebted to the work of\nProfessor Earle<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_jrc_hall4\" id=\"tag_jrc_hall4\" href=\"#note_jrc_hall4\">4</a> (see lines 4, 71, 517,\n852, 870, 926, 996, 1213, 1507, 2021, 3034, &amp;c.).</p>\n\n<p>Frequent reference is also made to the work of Cosijn,\n<i>Aanteekeningen op den Beowulf</i> (1892). The work of other scholars,\nsuch as Bugge, Heyne, Socin, is also referred to.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation is a literal prose version. It is constantly\ninterrupted by bits of running comment, designed to overcome the\ninherent obscurity of the poem, or to afford an elaborate digest of the\nstory if read without the translation (p. 7<ins class=\"correction\" title=\") invisible\">).</ins></p>\n\n<p>The rendering avoids archaisms.</p>\n\n<p>Bugge’s restoration is used at line 3150; the passage at line 2215 is\nnot restored.</p>",

A worse fate is in store for thee when\nthou meetest Grendel!’</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Art thou that Beowulf who strove with Breca, contested with him on the\nopen sea, in a swimming contest, when ye two for vainglory tried the\nfloods, and ventured your lives in deep water for idle boasting? Nor\ncould any man, friend or foe, dissuade you from your sorry enterprise\nwhen ye swam on the sea; when ye compassed the flowing stream with your\narms, meted out the sea-paths, battled with your hands, and glided over\nthe ocean; when the sea, the winter’s flood, surged with waves. Ye two\ntoiled in the water’s realm seven nights; he overcame you at swimming,\nhe had the greater strength. Then, at morning time, the ocean cast him\nup on the Heathoræmas’ land. Thence, dear to his people, he sought his\nbeloved fatherland, the land of the Brondings, his fair stronghold-city,\nwhere he had subjects and treasures and a borough. The son of Beanstan\nperformed faithfully all that he had pledged himself to. So I expect for\nthee a worse fatality,—though thou hast everywhere prevailed in\nrush of battle,—gruesome war,—if thou darest await Grendel\nat close quarters for the space of a night.’\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>The extract is typical of all that is best in the translation. It is\na thoroughly accurate piece of work, failing only where Wyatt’s edition\nof the text is unsatisfactory. Translations like ‘gave vent to secret\nthoughts of strife’ and ‘thou hast prevailed in the rush of battle’ show\nthat the work is the outcome of long thought and deep appreciation. At\ntimes the translation, as here, verges on a literary rendering. But in\nthis respect the first part of the poem is vastly superior to the later\nparts, though all three are marred by extreme literalness. Dr. Hall did\nnot always escape the strange diction that has so often before\ndisfigured the translations of <i>Beowulf</i>:—</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"lines\" summary=\"details of translations\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td class=\"number\">Line 2507,</td>\n<td>‘my unfriendly hug finished his bony frame.’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">„   2583,</td>\n<td>‘The Geat’s free-handed friend crowed not in pride of victory.’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">„   2655,</td>\n<td>‘Fell the foe and shield the Weder-Geat Lord’s life<ins class=\"correction\" title=\"close quote missing\">.’</ins></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">„   2688,</td>\n<td>‘the public scourge, the dreadful salamander.’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">„   2834,</td>\n<td>‘show his form’ (said of the Dragon).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"number\">„   2885,</td>\n<td>‘hopelessly escheated from your breed.’</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>It is also rather surprising to learn from Dr. Hall that Beowulf was\none of those that ‘advanced home government’ (l. 3005).</p>\n\n<p>It should be added that the explanatory comment which constantly\ninterrupts the translation, often six or eight times in a section, is\nannoying, both because it distracts the attention and because it is\noften presented in a style wholly inappropriate to the context.</p>\n\n<p>But this absence of ease and dignity does not hinder Dr. Hall’s\ntranslation from being an excellent rendering of the matter of the poem,\nat once less fanciful than Earle’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_jrc_hall5\" id=\"tag_jrc_hall5\" href=\"#note_jrc_hall5\">5</a> and\nmore modern than Garnett’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_jrc_hall6\" id=\"tag_jrc_hall6\" href=\"#note_jrc_hall6\">6</a>, its only rivals as a\nliteral translation.

        "introduction": "<h5>Contents of the Volume, and Nature of the Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>This was the first German book to give any extended account of the\npoem.</p>\n\n<p>The titles of the chapters are: I. Historische Anlehnung; II.\nMythischer Inhalt; III. Die geographischen Angaben; IV. Genealogische\nVerhältnisse der in dem Liede vorkommenden Helden; V. Uebersicht des\nInhalts des Gedichtes von Bëówulf. In this fifth chapter are found the\nextracts from <i>Beowulf</i>. It will be seen that the chapter is\nsomewhat subordinate to the others, its chief purpose being to furnish a\nkind of digest of the poem, to be used principally as a work of\nreference. A desire to condense leads the translator to omit lines\nthat he does not deem essential to\n\nan understanding of the events and characters of the poem. Unfortunately\nhis omissions are often the most poetical lines of the <i>Beowulf</i>.\nFor example, he omits the description of Beowulf’s sea-voyage;\nHrothgar’s account of the haunt of Grendel and his dam is curtailed; the\ndying words of Beowulf, perhaps the most beautiful lines in the poem,\nare clipped. Further examples may be found in the extract given below.\nThis insufficiency is excused by the fact that Leo’s main object in\npreparing the book was to prove certain theories that he held respecting\nthe origin and date of the poem.</p>\n\n<p>The text from which he translates is Kemble’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_leo2\" id=\"tag_leo2\" href=\"#note_leo2\">2</a>.</p>",

Er selbst wil der berümteste sein\nunter den wolken. Er sagte: ‘Bistu der Bëówulf, der mit Brëcca ein\nwetschwimmen hielt sieben tage und nächte lang, bis er dich in schwimmen\nbesigte, der kräftigere man; dann am achten morgen stig er auf\nHeáðorämes ansz land und gieng heim zu den Brondingen, wo er eine burg\nund edlesz gefolge und reichtum hatte?

        "description": "A Paraphrase for General Readers.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘The thought that these old romances may be presented to Englishmen of\nthe present day in a form which shall retain their real vigour without\nthe repulsive characteristics impressed on them by a comparatively rude\nand ignorant age may not, perhaps, be regarded as inexcusably\npresumptuous. With greater confidence it may be affirmed that, if we\nturn to these old legends or romances at all, it should be for the\npurpose of learning what they really were, and not with any wish of\nseeing them through a glass which shall reflect chiefly our own thoughts\nabout them and throw over them a colouring borrowed from the sentiment\nof the nineteenth century.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘These two conditions have, it is hoped, been strictly observed in the\nversions here given of some of the great romances of mediæval Europe.\nWhile special care has been taken to guard against the introduction even\nof phrases not in harmony with the original narratives, not less pains\nhave been bestowed on the task of preserving all that is essential in\nthe narrative; and thus it may perhaps be safely said that the readers\nof this volume will obtain from it an adequate knowledge of these\ntime-honoured stories, without having their attention and their patience\novertaxed by a multiplicity of superfluous and therefore utterly irksome\ndetails.’ —Preface, pp. vi, vii.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>\n\n<p>The poem is relieved of all the episodes except the prolog and King\nHrothgar’s discourse. Sometimes these omissions seem unnecessary. It is\ncertainly a mistake to sacrifice the swimming-match, lively in its\nnarrative, dramatic in setting.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the author makes an attempt to preserve as much as\npossible of the original style. So anxious is he to save every\npicturesque word of the original, that he sometimes transfers\nexpressions from the passages which he is obliged to drop and inserts\nthem in other parts of the story.</p>",
        "extract": "<blockquote>\n‘Away to the westward among the people of the Geáts lived a man,\nstrongest of his race, tall, mighty-handed, and clean made. He was a\nthane, kinsman to Hygelác the Geátish chief, and nobly born, being son\nof Ecgtheow the Wægmunding, a war-prince who wedded with the\ndaughter of Hrethel the Geát. This man heard of Grendel’s deeds, of\nHrothgár’s sorrow, and the sore distress of the Danes, and having sought\nout fifteen warriors, he entered into a new-pitched ship to seek the\nwar-king across the sea. Bird-like the vessel’s swan-necked prow\nbreasted the white sea-foam till the warriors reached the windy walls of\ncliff and the steep mountains of the Danish shores. They thanked God\nbecause the wave-ways had been easy to them; then, sea-wearied, lashed\ntheir wide-bosomed ship to an anchorage, donned their war-weeds, and\ncame to Heorot, the gold and jewelled house. Brightly gleamed their\narmour and merrily sang the ring-iron of their trappings as they marched\ninto the palace.’ —Pages 384–5.\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>The object of a paraphrase is to present all the essential matter of\nthe original, in a style materially simpler than, though not unrelated\nto, the original.</p>\n\n<p>The matter of Mr. Jones’s paraphrase is not above criticism. It is\nfull of minor errors. In the extract, for example, the original does not\nsay that the heroes ‘donned their war-weeds,’ nor that there were\nmountains on the shores of Denmark.</p>\n\n<p>The style of the work is much better. It is throughout strong and\nclear, not over-sentimental. It is, perhaps, too intimate; it savors\nslightly of the <i>Märchen</i>. This absence of vigor and remoteness may\nbe due to the nature of the volume of which this paraphrase is only a\npart.</p>",

Wägner (Leipzig, 1881).</p>\n\n\n<h5>Aim of the Book.</h5>\n\n<p>From the nature of the changes made in the story, it is evident that\nan appeal is made to younger readers. This is borne out by the statement\non p. 9 of the Introduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Changes in the Story.</h5>\n\n<p>The story does not pretend to do more than follow the most general\noutlines of the original. The most important changes are in the first\ndivision of the poem, where it would seem that no changes whatever were\nneeded. The principal additions are the following:—</p>\n\n<p>(1) A minstrel flees from plague-stricken Heorot, sails to the\nGeatish land, and sings the terror wrought by Grendel, urging Beowulf to\ncome and save the people.</p>\n\n<p>(2) The swimming-match is introduced into the action of the story,\nwith the <i>motif</i> radically altered. Breca is represented as winning\nthe match.</p>\n\n<p>(3) The incident of Beowulf’s refusal of the crown is amplified and\nintroduced into the story at the opening of the third part.</p>\n\n<p>(4) The story differs from the original in a number of minor\ndetails.</p>",
        "extract": "<blockquote>\nThe minstrel tuned his harp and sang of Beowulf’s heroic deeds, and\nprophesied that he would conquer and slay the monster of the morass.\nThis praise made Hunford, one of the courtiers, angry and jealous.

Upon this, Beowulf\nexclaimed indignantly that he had won a good sword instead of the golden\nchain, and that it was sharp enough both to pierce the hide of the\nmonster and to cut out a slanderous tongue.\n</blockquote>",

The bit of repartee in the last sentence is wholly\nforeign to the Beowulf manner, which is outright and downright—the\n\nvery opposite of subtilty. The false manner is evident at once when we\ncompare the reply of the hero in the original, ‘Thou art the murderer of\nthine own brethren, and thou shalt be damned in Hell. Wait till\nto-night, and thou shalt see which of us is the stronger.’</p>\n\n<p>The story is, if possible, more garbled than the style. The mission\nof the minstrel and the mangled account of the swimming-match have no\nessential or artistic relation to the context. They are merely inserted\nto add to the action of the piece.</p>\n\n<p>The popularity of the book is attested by the number of editions\nthrough which it has passed. The volume contains also paraphrases of the\nlegends about Arthur, Charlemagne, and Tannhäuser, as well as the story\nof the Nibelungs. These must account for its enduring success; but it is\nunfortunate that this, the poorest of the Beowulf paraphrases, should\nthus have found an audience which it did not deserve and could never\nhave commanded for itself.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>Therese Dahn.</h5>\n\n<p>Therese Dahn, born Freiin von Droste-Hülshoff, was born in 1845, and\nmarried Felix Dahn in 1873. With him she published in 1873 at Leipzig a\nvolume of poems (<i>Gedichte</i>). For certain of her verses in this\nvolume she received high praise. She has since continued creative work.\nShe resides at Breslau, where Felix Dahn is professor in the University.\nOf the stories in the present volume she wrote, beside <i>Beowulf</i>,\n<i>Die Wölsungen</i>, <i>Kudrun</i>, the story of König Wilkinus,\n&amp;c., <i>Wieland der Schmied</i>, <i>Walther und Hildgund</i>, and\nthe stories from the <i>Dietrich</i> saga and the <i>Nibelungen</i>\nsaga.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>\n\n<p>The following parts of the story are omitted entirely: the account of\nthe first King Beowulf in the Prolog; the Sigemund episode, Hrothgar’s\nDiscourse; the Thrytho episode; the Freawaru episode; Beowulf’s account\nof his Fight with Grendel as told to King Hygelac; the Battle of\nRavenswood.</p>\n\n<p>Other changes in the story are as follows: the sorrows of the Danes\nas told in the Prolog are attributed to the reign of King Heremod; in a\nseparate Kapitel (III) are gathered the Sorrows of King Hrethel, the\naccount of Ongentheow, the Fall of Hygelac, and the Death of Heardred.\nThe Fight at Finnsburg is added and an original beginning provided\nfor it.</p>\n\n<p>Obscure words, phrases, and lines are omitted; and explanatory words\nare inserted from time to time.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Indebtedness to Simrock.</h5>\n\n<p>The translation was evidently made with Simrock’s translation<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_dahn2\" id=\"tag_dahn2\" href=\"#note_dahn2\">2</a>\nin hand; possibly it may have been made directly\n\nfrom that version. Evidence of the dependence upon Simrock may be found\nat every step. The forms of the proper names invented by Simrock are\nrepeated here (e.g., Aeskhere, Hädkynn, Ochthere). His renderings of the\nunique words in the poem (sometimes in a slightly simplified form) are\nused in the paraphrase. Often the original word used by Simrock is added\nin parentheses (cf., e.g., Simrock, p. 72.6 with Dahn, p. 382,\nand p. 73.44 with Dahn, p. 383). Further evidence may be found\nby comparing the extracts given in this work.</p>",

        "description": "Digest, Running Comment, and Translation of Copious Extracts into\nImitative Measures.",
        "introduction": "<h5>Reasons for including this Book.</h5>\n\n<p>This volume is included here because of the great influence it has\nhad in forming popular notions regarding the <i>Beowulf</i>. The\neminence of Mr. Brooke as a critic and as a poet has given him the\nattention of an audience hardly commanded by any other writer included\nin this paper.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the number of lines actually translated by Mr. Brooke is equal\nto that in many of the volumes described in this section.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Difference between the two Editions.</h5>\n\n<p>The account in the second volume is much shorter than that in the\nfirst; only twelve pages are given to the story of Beowulf, while the\nfirst volume gives forty-three. The later book omits all discussion of\nthe episodes, and, although parts of the older volume are retained, the\nmatter is, in general, re-written.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Method of Translation.</h5>\n\n<p>Translated extracts accompany the story as told by Mr. Brooke.</p>\n\n<p>In his Preface (p. ix), the author speaks of the futility of prose\ntranslations of poetry, and of the inadequacy of modern English media\nfor translating the spirit of the poetry. Finally he adopts a line which\nhe hopes will ‘fulfil the needs and follow closely the peculiarities’ of\nOld English.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘I chose after many experiments, the trochaic movement used in this\nbook, each half-line consisting of trochees following one another, with\na syllable at the end, chiefly a long one, to mark the division of the\nline. I varied the line as much as I could, introducing, often\nrashly, metrical changes; for the fault of this movement is its\nmonotony. I have sometimes tried an iambic movement, but rarely;\nfor this trochaic line with a beat at the end of each half-verse seemed\nto me to get the nearest to the sound of the Anglo-Saxon line, even\nthough it is frequently un-similar to that line itself. I used\nalliteration whenever I could, and stressed as much as possible the\nalliterated words, and I changed the length of the line with the changes\nof the original. But when I could not easily alliterate my line or\nstress the alliterated word, I did not try to do so.’\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The author adopts an archaic diction. The word-order of the Old\nEnglish is followed whenever possible.</p>\n\n\n<h5>Text Used.</h5>\n\n<p>The text appears to be that of Grein-Wülker (1883).</p>",
        "extract": "<div class=\"verse\">\n<p>There at haven stood,     hung with rings the ship,</p>\n<p>Ice-bright, for the outpath eager,     craft of\nAethelings.</p>\n<p>So their lord, the well-beloved,     all at length they\nlaid</p>\n<p>In the bosom of the bark,     him the\nbracelet-giver,—</p>\n<p>By the mast the mighty king.     Many gifts were there</p>\n<p>Fretted things of fairness     brought from far-off\nways.—</p>\n\n<p>Never heard I of a keel     hung more comelily about</p>\n<p>With the weeds of war,     with the weapons of the\nbattle,</p>\n<p>With the bills and byrnies.

        "criticism": "<p>While the extracts cannot always be praised for their accuracy, they\nare, perhaps, sufficiently faithful for a popular work. When the author\nundertakes to emend the text for himself, or offers an original\ninterpretation, his work is not always trustworthy. Emendations in his\nBeowulf selections, however, are rare.</p>\n\n<p>The style of the extracts seems needlessly obscure. This is due in\npart to following too closely the original word-order (see lines 4 and 5\nof the extract), and in part to the free use of archaic language. Mr.\nBrooke does not hesitate to employ such forms as, ‘house-carles,’\n‘grit-wall,’ ‘ness-slopes,’ ‘host-shafts,’ ‘war-wood,’ ‘gold-flakèd\nshields,’ ‘grinning-masked helms,’ which it would seem must be quite\nunintelligible to the majority of Mr. Brooke’s readers.</p>\n\n<p>The verse, which has been fully discussed above, is, perhaps, the\nmost satisfactory feature of Mr. Brooke’s work. Of course it is not\nstrictly imitative, as he himself explains, but it gives a fairly good\nimpression of the movement of the Old English verse.</p>",

        "introduction": "<h5>The Author, and the Aim of her Book.</h5>\n\n<p>Miss Zenaïde Alexeievna Ragozin, a Russian by birth, an American by\nadoption, has devoted herself to the popularization of history and\nmythology. In the series <i>Stories of the Nations</i>, she has\npublished, <i>The Story of Chaldea</i>, <i>The Story of Assyria</i>,\n<i>The Story of Media, Babylon, and Persia</i>, <i>The Story of Vedic\nIndia</i><ins class=\"correction\" title=\"text has superfluous close quote\">. </ins>Of late she has turned her attention to the mythology of\nthe various European nations, and has written of Siegfried, Frithjof,\nand Roland.</p>\n\n<p>The object of her work may be given in her own words:—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘(The series is) intended as parallel reading to history, and planned to\nillustrate history. . . . Great changes are coming over\nthe schools, . . . changes in the right direction, which\nmay shortly amount to a revolution, when there will be no reason why\nthese <i>Tales of the Heroic Ages</i> should not, although addressed to\nyoung people at large, find a place, if not in the school curriculum, at\nleast in the wide margin of so-called ‘Supplementary Reading.’ May they\nprove acceptable, not alone to the young, to whom they are specially\naddressed, but also, as has been felicitously said, to “the old with\nyoung tastes.”’ —Pages xx, xxii.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h5>Method of Paraphrase.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘(The style) should be simple and epical; faithfully following the main\nlines, bringing out also the characteristic details—the poetical\nbeauties, picturesque traits, and original dialogue, as much as may be\nconsistent with necessary condensation and, frequently, elimination. It\nshould be a consecutive, lively narrative, with the necessary\nelucidating explanations incorporated in the text and with the fewest\nand briefest possible footnotes, while it should contain no critical or\nmythological digressions. . . . What we want in telling\nit to the young, is to take the epic just as it is, condensing and\nexpurgating, but not changing; rendering the characters, scenes and\nsituations with the faithfulness and reverence due to the masterpiece of\na race; using as much as possible, especially in the dialogue, the words\nof the original. . . . (The language) should be simple,\nthough not untinged with quaintness, and even in places a certain degree\nof archaism.’ —Pages xvi, xix, xxi.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Indebtedness to Earle.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Professor Earle’s<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_ragozin1\" id=\"tag_ragozin1\" href=\"#note_ragozin1\">1</a> version has been fully\nutilized in the present volume, even to the extent of frequently making\nuse of its wording, where it is not too archaic or literal for ordinary\npurposes.’ —Page 330, footnote.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some notion of the extent of this borrowing may be had by examining\nthe extract printed below and the criticism that follows.</p>",
        "extract": "<blockquote>\nYet there was one eye that gleamed not with merriment and goodwill, one\nhead that hatched no friendly thoughts, because the heart swelled with\nmalice and envy. Unferth it was, the king’s own story-teller, who sat at\nhis feet, to be ready at all times to amuse him. He broached a\nquarrelsome theme—an adventure in Beowulf’s youth, the only\ncontest in his record the issue of which, though hard fought, might be\ncalled doubtful. For this Unferth was an envious wight, whose soul\ngrudged that any man should achieve greater things than himself.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘Art thou not,’ he began tauntingly, ‘that same Beowulf who strove with\nBreca on open sea in a swimming-match, in which ye both\n\nwantonly exposed your lives, and no man, either friend or foe, could\nturn you from the foolish venture? A se’nnight ye twain toiled in\nthe realm of the waters, and, if I err not, he outdid thee in swimming,\nfor he had greater strength. Wherefore I fear me much that thou mayest\nmeet with sorry luck if thou darest to bide here for Grendel for the\nspace of a whole night.’\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>It may be inferred from the dependence upon the work of Earle that\nMiss Ragozin’s knowledge of Old English is of the slightest. This\ninference is borne out by frequent misapprehension of the original\nsense, due in large measure to the use of a single translation. Thus on\npage 245, Grendel is called ‘the God-sent scourge,’ and, again, on\np. 322, Beowulf is described as having been ‘most genial to his\nnobles.’ Both of these errors are due to misapprehension of Professor\nEarle’s translation. The list of proper names on p. 331 reveals an\nignorance of some fundamental facts of Old English pronunciation. Of\ncourse, an intimate knowledge of the Beowulf style and diction is not\nindispensable to the writer of a paraphrase, but the writer who has it\nwill naturally be superior to the writer without it. For illustration,\nMiss Thomson<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_ragozin2\" id=\"tag_ragozin2\" href=\"#note_ragozin2\">2</a> never misinterprets a passage as does Miss\nRagozin on page 264, where nearly every sentence is false to the Beowulf\nmanner.</p>\n\n<p>The paraphrase is slightly disfigured by the distinctively Romance\nwords which disfigure Earle’s translation.</p>\n\n<p>But these slight defects need not blind us to the service done by\nMiss Ragozin in making Beowulf accessible to school children. The style\nis, in general, strong and effective, not without some of the beauty and\ndignity of the Old English, but relieved of the more obscure and\nrecondite features of that style.</p>",

        "extract": "<blockquote>\nBut while they feasted envy stirred in the heart of Unferth, son of\nEcglaf. He was the King’s orator, and he took it ill that Beowulf should\nhave come to the land of the Danes on this great enterprise, for he was\none who could not endure that any man under heaven should do greater\ndeeds than himself. Therefore he stood up in the hall and spake: ‘Art\nthou that Beowulf who contended with Breca in swimming on the open sea?\n‘Twas, indeed, a foolhardy thing so to put your lives in jeopardy,\nyet no man could turn you from your adventure. Seven days and nights ye\ntoiled, one against the other, but he in the end prevailed, for he had\nthe greater strength. And on the eighth morning the waves cast him\nashore on the land of the Heathoram, whence he journeyed back to the\ncity of the Bronding, of which he was lord. So did Breca, son of\nBeanstan, make good his boast against thee.’\n</blockquote>",

His most evident mistakes are\nin the forms of the proper names. Such forms as these occur in his book:\nVeleda, Hugon, Weopstan (sic), Hrethin, Hrethet.</p>\n\n<p>The diction is unfortunate. The coast-warden becomes a ‘squire’\n(p. 7); Heorot is a ‘banqueting hall’ (p. 4, showing the\ninfluence of Kemble’s translation); Beowulf and Breca were ‘pages at the\nKing’s court’ (p. 13, showing the influence of Earle’s\ntranslation).</p>\n\n<p>Petty inaccuracies occur throughout, such as, ‘I counsel\n\nthat thou refuse not’ (p. 9); ‘A faithful squire must needs know\nthe troubles of his lord’ (p. 7).

        "introduction": "<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘It is meant mainly to arouse in children an interest in the beginnings\nof our literature—a subject that is still terribly neglected\nin schools. It makes no pretension to being an adequate or satisfactory\nversion for grown-up readers.’ —Page 6.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h5>Method of Paraphrase.</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n‘[Discrepancies in the poem] I have endeavoured to smooth over by\nomission or by very slight additions; and whenever of two readings of a\ndoubtful passage, one is more easily comprehensible than the other,\nI have always adhered to this, even if on philological grounds it\nseems less probable.’...\n\n\n<p>‘Many of the episodes in the story have been greatly shortened or\naltogether omitted, since they interrupt the course of the narrative, or\ndivert the interest from the main theme.’ —Pages 5, 6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This statement is more modest than need be. It will be found that\nonly two of the episodes are passed without mention—the Prolog and\nthe Tale of Thrytho. The Legend of Sigemund and the Tale of Finn are\nrather fully treated, and the Story of Freawaru and the Battle of\nRavenswood are both referred to. In each case the episodes are carefully\nwoven into the story, and that without superfluous words.</p>\n\n<p>The words and sentences which are supplied are very carefully chosen,\nand most of them have a prototype somewhere in the poem.</p>",
        "extract": "<blockquote>\nNow, though most of Hrothgar’s men rejoiced to see Beowulf, and honoured\nhim for his generous thought in coming to their help, there was one who\nlooked on him with dislike and envy, and was jealous of the favour shown\nhim by the king. This was Hunferth, who was sitting on the daïs at\nHrothgar’s feet. And when he heard what this visitor intended to do, he\ngrew angry and moody, because he could not bear that any other man on\nearth should obtain greater honour than he himself. So he began to rake\nup old tales that he had heard of Beowulf, and tried to turn them to his\nhurt, saying scornfully:\n\n<p>‘Art thou that Beowulf who once strove on the wide sea in a\nswimming-match with Breca, when ye two in boasting dared to breast the\nwave, and for vainglory risked your lives in the deep water? There was\nno man, friend nor foe, who could dissuade you from that sorrowful\njourney; but ye swam in the surf, stretching out your arms over the\nwaves, and stirring up the surge with your hands. So did ye glide across\nthe ocean, while the waves weltered in wintry storms, and for seven\nnights ye laboured in the tumult of the seas. But in the end the victory\nwas with Breca, for his might was the greater. Then on the morning of\nthe eighth day the tide bore him to the shore of Norway, whence he\nvisited his beloved home, the fair city of safety, where he ruled over\nmany people, over towns and treasure. Truly he did perform all his boast\nagainst thee.’</p>\n</blockquote>",
        "criticism": "<p>In the opinion of the present writer, no better paraphrase of\n<i>Beowulf</i> exists.</p>\n\n<p>It is perhaps unfortunate that the word ‘translated’ is used on the\ntitle-page, for this is misleading. The proper form is that used on the\ncover of the book, ‘Beowulf, told by Miss Clara Thomson.’</p>\n\n<p>It were sufficient praise to point out that the author has contrived\nto retain practically all of the poem, without ever falsifying its\nspirit by introducing a superabundance of explanatory phrases<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thomson2\" id=\"tag_thomson2\" href=\"#note_thomson2\">2</a>. She is always true to the story (as Miss\nRagozin<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thomson3\" id=\"tag_thomson3\" href=\"#note_thomson3\">3</a> is not, for example, in the first section of her\nwork); she is equally true to the spirit of the poem (as Mr. Gibb<a class=\"tag\" name=\"tag_thomson4\" id=\"tag_thomson4\" href=\"#note_thomson4\">4</a> is not). The style is both vigorous and simple,\nnot unworthy of the story it tells.</p>\n\n<p>It will be surprising if Miss Thomson’s work is not popular in\nEngland, and the book should be known and used in this country.</p>",
